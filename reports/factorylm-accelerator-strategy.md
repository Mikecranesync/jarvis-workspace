### YC Application Key Points

**One-liner (they read hundreds):**
> "FactoryLM is an AI copilot that helps maintenance technicians diagnose and repair industrial equipment, reducing downtime by 40%."

**What are you building?**
> We're building AI agents that understand industrial equipment. Technicians snap a photo of a malfunctioning machine, and FactoryLM identifies the equipment, pulls the relevant manuals, and guides them through troubleshooting. Think "Siri for maintenance techs" but it actually knows what a PLC fault code means.

**Why you?**
> I spent 15 years as a maintenance technician before teaching myself to code. I've debugged PLCs at 2 AM with a paper manual and a flashlight. Every product decision I make comes from lived experience. My competitors are software people trying to understand factories; I'm a factory person who learned software.
