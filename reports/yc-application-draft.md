# Y Combinator X26 Application Draft — FactoryLM

**Deadline:** February 9, 2026 @ 8:00 PM PT
**Apply at:** apply.ycombinator.com

## COMPANY SECTION

### Company Name
**FactoryLM**

### One-liner (what does your company do?)
*Keep it under 80 characters. Be specific.*

> AI copilot that helps maintenance technicians diagnose and repair industrial equipment.

*Alternative:*
> We turn equipment photos into repair instructions using AI that reads PLCs and manuals.

---

### What does your company do? (250 words max)
*Be specific. Avoid jargon. Explain like you're talking to a smart friend who doesn't know your industry.*

**DRAFT:**

> FactoryLM helps maintenance technicians fix industrial equipment faster. 
>
> When a machine breaks, technicians waste 30-60 minutes just figuring out what they're looking at and finding the right manual. Our AI does this in seconds.
>
> Here's how it works: A technician snaps a photo of a broken machine. FactoryLM identifies the equipment (manufacturer, model, serial number), pulls the relevant manual sections, reads any fault codes or error messages, and provides step-by-step troubleshooting guidance.
>
> We're not building generic chatbot AI. We've trained on thousands of equipment manuals, P&ID diagrams, and PLC programs. Our system understands that a "Fault 27" on an Allen-Bradley PLC means something different than on a Siemens drive.
>
> The problem is massive: US manufacturers lose $50B/year to unplanned downtime. The average maintenance tech is 55 years old, and there aren't enough young people entering the trade. Institutional knowledge walks out the door every day.
>
> We're starting with discrete manufacturing (automotive, aerospace, food & beverage) where downtime costs $10K-$100K per hour. Our first product integrates with existing CMMS systems so companies don't have to change their workflows.
>
> I built this because I spent 15 years as a maintenance technician. I've debugged PLCs at 2 AM with a paper manual and a dying flashlight. This is the tool I wish I had.

### Why did you pick this idea to work on?
*What domain expertise do you have? Why are you the right person?*

**DRAFT:**

> I was a maintenance technician for 15 years before I learned to code. I've bled on conveyor belts, burned myself on steam lines, and spent countless nights troubleshooting equipment with nothing but a paper manual and Google.
>
> Every time I fixed something, I thought: "Why isn't there an app for this?" The answer was always the same—software people don't understand factories, and factory people don't write software.
>
> I taught myself Python and machine learning specifically to solve this problem. I've built OCR pipelines that can read nameplates covered in grease. I've trained models on electrical schematics and ladder logic. I know what a technician needs because I was one.
>
> My competitors are enterprise software companies who've never touched a wrench. They build top-down "digital twin" platforms that cost $500K and take 18 months to implement. I'm building bottom-up tools that work on day one.

### What's your progress? (Traction, users, revenue)
*Anything counts. Be honest but highlight what you have.*

**DRAFT (customize with real numbers):**

> - Working prototype deployed: Photo → OCR → Equipment ID → Manual lookup → Troubleshooting
> - Integrated with Atlas CMMS for work order creation
> - [X] pilot conversations with manufacturing companies
> - [X] photos processed through the system
> - [X] in LOIs/commitments
> - Built by one technical founder in [X] months
>
> *[Mike: Fill in actual numbers. Even small ones matter.]*

### How do you know people want this?
*Evidence of demand, not just your opinion.*

**DRAFT:**

> Three signals:
>
> 1. **Personal experience:** I spent 15 years watching technicians struggle with the same problems. Every plant I worked in had binders of manuals that no one could find when they needed them.
>
> 2. **Industry pain:** US manufacturing has 600,000+ unfilled maintenance jobs. The average technician is 55. Companies are desperate for anything that helps less experienced techs perform like veterans.
>
> 3. **Market validation:** [Add any pilot conversations, LOIs, or user feedback here]
>
> The day I showed a maintenance manager the prototype, he said: "This would have saved us $40K last month." That machine was down for 6 hours because the tech couldn't find the manual.

---

### What's your business model?
*How do you make money?*

**DRAFT:**

> SaaS subscription per technician seat:
> - **Starter:** $49/tech/month (photo ID, manual lookup)
> - **Pro:** $99/tech/month (+ troubleshooting, CMMS integration)
> - **Enterprise:** Custom (+ API, training data, on-prem)
>
> A mid-size plant with 20 technicians = $24K ARR.
> If we prevent one hour of downtime per month, ROI is 10x+.

---

### What are the top 1-3 things you need to figure out?
*Be honest about unknowns.*

**DRAFT:**

> 1. **Distribution:** Reaching maintenance managers at scale. They're not on Twitter or Product Hunt.
> 2. **Manual licensing:** Getting official access to OEM documentation at scale.
> 3. **Edge deployment:** Some plants have limited internet. Need offline capability.

---

## FOUNDER SECTION

### Tell us about yourself
*Background, why you're qualified.*

**DRAFT:**

> I spent 15 years as an industrial maintenance technician, working on everything from CNC machines to packaging lines. I've held journeyman certifications in electrical and mechanical maintenance.
>
> At 35, I taught myself to code because I was frustrated that no one was building the tools I needed. I learned Python, machine learning, and web development through online courses and building projects.
>
> I understand both sides: the reality of factory floors and the potential of modern AI. That's rare. Most people in industrial AI came from software and are guessing about what factories need. I lived it.

---

### How long have founders known each other and how did you meet?
*Solo founder answer.*

**DRAFT (if solo):**

> Solo founder. I've been building this for [X] months while working on it full-time. [If applicable: mention any advisors, early team members, or technical collaborators]

---

## VIDEO (1 minute)

### What to show:
1. **You, talking to camera** (10 sec): "I'm Mike, and I'm building FactoryLM."
2. **The problem** (15 sec): "Maintenance techs waste hours finding the right manual and figuring out what's wrong."
3. **Demo** (25 sec): Show the actual product. Photo → identification → troubleshooting.
4. **Why you** (10 sec): "I was a maintenance tech for 15 years. I built this because no one else would."

### Tips:
- Use your phone. Raw is fine.
- Show the real product, not slides.
- Energy matters more than polish.
