It knows that section 4.7.2 is relevant to alarm code 0x4A2B. It builds semantic connections between problems and solutions.\"\n\n*[Visual: Knowledge graph being built in real-time]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Next: Alarm Triage. This agent is basically an industrial detective.\"\n\n*[Screen recording: Multiple alarms appearing on dashboard]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Here's a real scenario from last Tuesday. Seven alarms fired within three minutes. Alarm Triage looked at the timing, the equipment involved, the historical patterns...\"\n\n*[Animation: Agent connecting dots between alarms]*\n\n**Mike:** \"...and determined that six of them were just cascading effects from one failing temperature sensor. Instead of chasing seven problems, maintenance fixed one.\"\n\n*[Before/after: Chaotic alarm list → Single root cause identified]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Then we have the Diagnostic agents. These are the heavy hitters.\"\n\n*[Complex diagnostic interface]*\n\n**Mike:** \"They don't just identify problems - they understand WHY problems happen. This one is currently analyzing vibration patterns from a conveyor motor.\"\n\n*[Real-time vibration analysis with AI interpretation]*\n\n**Mike:** \"It's detected a bearing frequency that suggests early-stage wear. Probably three weeks before catastrophic failure. That's a $50 diagnostic preventing a $50,000 breakdown.\"\n\n**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** \"$50 diagnostic → Prevents $50,000 breakdown\"\n\n*[Dashboard showing agent performance metrics]*\n\n**Mike:** \"And here's the really cool part - they're all talking to each other. When Diagnostic Agent finds a pattern, it tells Manual Hunter to look for similar cases. When Manual Hunter finds a new solution, it tells Alarm Triage to watch for those symptoms.\"\n\n*[Network visualization: Agents sharing information]*\n\n**Mike:** \"It's like having a team of experts that never forget anything and instantly share every insight.\"\n\n---\n\n## LIVE DEMO (6:30-8:00)\n*[Real-time screen recording, dramatic music]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Enough theory. Let me show you this system actually working.\"\n\n*[Cut to: Mike at computer with multiple monitors]*\n\n**Mike:** \"I'm going to simulate a real industrial problem and let the agents handle it live.\"\n\n*[Screen recording: Simulated factory environment]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Here's our test factory. Everything's running normally. Green lights across the board.\"\n\n*[Simulation interface showing normal operations]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Now I'm going to introduce a problem. I'm simulating a cooling pump that's starting to cavitate.\"\n\n*[Visual: Pump status changing, subtle warnings appearing]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Watch this. The first agent to notice isn't even monitoring the pump directly. It's the Vibration Analysis agent that detects the frequency signature.\"\n\n*[Agent dashboard: Vibration agent flagging anomaly]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Vibration agent immediately alerts Diagnostic agent. Diagnostic agent starts correlating - pump vibration, temperature trends, flow rates...\"\n\n*[Multiple data streams being analyzed simultaneously]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Meanwhile, Manual Hunter is already pulling up technical documentation for this specific pump model. It knows the cavitation symptoms, the failure modes, the recommended actions.\"\n\n*[Document snippets being highlighted and connected]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Seventeen seconds. From first symptom detection to root cause identification with recommended maintenance action.\"\n\n*[Timer showing: 00:00:17]*\n\n**Mike:** \"But here's where it gets really cool. Watch what happens when I approve the maintenance recommendation.\"\n\n*[Mike clicking \"Approve Maintenance\"]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Maintenance Coordinator agent automatically schedules the work, orders the replacement parts from the preferred supplier, and notifies the maintenance team with a detailed work order.\"\n\n*[Work order being generated with parts list, procedures, safety notes]*\n\n**Mike:** \"The entire chain - detection, diagnosis, documentation, scheduling - completely automated. No human intervention required unless you want it.\"\n\n**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** \"Detection → Diagnosis → Action: 100% Automated\"\n\n---\n\n## OBSERVABILITY (8:00-9:15)\n*[Dashboard and monitoring interfaces]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Now, you might be wondering - this is cool, but how do I know it's actually working? How do I trust an AI army with my million-dollar production line?\"\n\n*[Cut to: Comprehensive monitoring dashboard]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Meet the observability stack. Every agent action is logged, tracked, and visualized.\"\n\n*[Grafana dashboard with multiple panels]*\n\n**Mike:** \"This is our Grafana setup. We track everything. Agent response times, accuracy rates, token consumption, cost per diagnosis, false positive rates.\"\n\n*[Real metrics scrolling]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Here's last month's performance. Alarm Triage agent processed 1,247 alarms. Correctly identified root causes 94.7% of the time. Average response time: 2.3 seconds.\"\n\n**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** \"1,247 alarms processed | 94.7% accuracy | 2.3s average response\"\n\n*[Cost tracking dashboard]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Cost tracking is critical. Each agent logs every API call, every token used. This diagnostic that just saved us $50,000? It cost $0.23 in compute.\"\n\n*[ROI calculation showing on screen]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Return on investment is insane. The entire system pays for itself if it prevents just one major downtime event per year.\"\n\n*[Agent health monitoring]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Agent health monitoring shows which agents are performing well, which ones need more training, which ones are burning through tokens inefficiently.\"\n\n*[Performance comparison charts]*\n\n**Mike:** \"And here's my favorite part - the learning curves. Watch how agent accuracy improves over time as they see more data, learn more patterns.\"\n\n*[Trend lines showing improving performance metrics]*\n\n**Mike:** \"This isn't just automation. This is automation that gets smarter every day.\"\n\n---\n\n## HOW YOU CAN BUILD THIS (9:15-10:45)\n*[Code repositories, architecture diagrams]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Alright, so you're probably thinking - this is awesome, but how do I actually build something like this for my operation?\"\n\n*[GitHub repository mockup]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Here's the plan. I'm open-sourcing the core architecture. The agent frameworks, the edge connectivity, the observability stack - all of it.\"\n\n*[Code snippets showing agent templates]*\n\n**Mike:** \"You'll be able to clone the repo, customize it for your specific equipment, and deploy your own Master of Puppets system.\"\n\n*[Installation guide interface]*\n\n**Mike:** \"The documentation will include step-by-step deployment guides, agent customization templates, and integration examples for common industrial protocols.\"\n\n*[Educational content preview]*\n\n**Mike:** \"But more than just code - I'm creating a complete educational series. Deep dives into industrial AI, LLM fine-tuning for technical domains, edge deployment strategies.\"\n\n*[Course outline showing multiple modules]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Think of it as Industrial AI University. By the end, you'll not just have working agents - you'll understand how to build, deploy, and optimize AI systems for your specific industrial challenges.\"\n\n*[Community platform mockup]*\n\n**Mike:** \"And there's going to be a community. Share your agent configurations, collaborate on training data, help each other solve industrial AI challenges.\"\n\n*[Timeline graphic]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Timeline: Core architecture releases in Q2. Educational content starts next month. Community platform launches with the code.\"\n\n**[ON-SCREEN TEXT]:** \"Q2: Open Source Release | Now: Educational Content | Q2: Community Platform\"\n\n**Mike:** \"This isn't just about my factory.

I'm documenting this entire journey. Every breakthrough, every failure, every 'holy crap that actually worked' moment.\"\n\n*[Notification bell animation]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Hit that notification bell because this space moves fast and you don't want to miss the important updates.\"\n\n*[Social media handles]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Follow me on Twitter for daily updates. I share code snippets, architecture thoughts, and probably too many industrial memes.\"\n\n*[Community Discord invite]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Join the Discord. That's where the real conversations happen. People are already sharing their industrial AI experiments, asking technical questions, collaborating on solutions.\"\n\n*[Preview of upcoming content]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Next week's video: I'm doing a live coding session where we build an agent from scratch. You'll see exactly how to create a specialized industrial AI agent that can diagnose motor problems.\"\n\n*[Exciting preview clips]*\n\n**Mike:** \"Week after that: I'm taking you inside a real factory deployment. Showing the actual installation, the integration challenges, the first week performance results.\"\n\n*[Call for community engagement]*\n\n**Mike:** \"And if you're already working on industrial AI projects, reach out. I want to feature community builds, share different approaches, learn from what others are creating.\"\n\n---\n\n## OUTRO (11:30-12:00)\n*[Master of Puppets music returns, softer]*\n\n**Mike:** \"The age of dumb factories is ending.
