I'm reaching out because most maintenance managers in [INDUSTRY] tell me the same thing:\n\n**\"Our operators are drowning in alarms, and when our senior guys retire, we lose decades of tribal knowledge overnight.\"**\n\nSound familiar?\n\nHere's what we've seen at similar [INDUSTRY] plants:\n- 🚨 **Alarm fatigue:** Operators get 200+ alarms per day, 85% are nuisance\n- 🧠 **Knowledge gap:** When Bob retires, his 30 years of \"I know that sound\" goes with him\n- 💸 **Reactive cycles:** You're always fighting fires instead of preventing them\n\n**What if your PLCs could actually teach your team?**\n\nWe've built an AI system that learns from your alarm patterns and senior operators' responses. Instead of just logging alarms, it captures the \"why\" behind every decision.\n\n**Real results from [SIMILAR_COMPANY_SIZE] [INDUSTRY] plant:**\n- 70% reduction in nuisance alarms in first 30 days\n- New operators performing like 5-year veterans within weeks\n- Prevented 3 major shutdowns by catching patterns human eyes missed\n\n[FIRST_NAME], I'd like to offer [COMPANY_NAME] a **free 30-day pilot** on one of your critical production lines.

Most plants have all the data they need to prevent these shutdowns – it's just buried in alarm logs that nobody has time to analyze.\n\nThat's exactly what our AI does. It finds the patterns that predict problems before they become emergencies.\n\n**Quick question:** What's the longest unplanned shutdown [COMPANY_NAME] has had in the last 6 months? If it's more than a few hours, this conversation could be worth millions.\n\nWould next Tuesday or Wednesday work for a brief call?\n\n[YOUR_NAME]  \n[PHONE] | [EMAIL]\n\n---\n\n## EMAIL 3: Break-up (Day 7)\n\n### Subject Line:\n**\"Closing the loop on [COMPANY_NAME]'s alarm management\"**\n\n### Email Body:\n\nHi [FIRST_NAME],\n\nI've reached out a couple times about helping [COMPANY_NAME] tackle alarm fatigue and knowledge transfer challenges.
