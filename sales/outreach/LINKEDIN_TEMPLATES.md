## FOLLOW-UP INMAILS

### InMail 1: Initial Outreach (2-3 days after connection)

**Subject: "Quick question about alarm management at [COMPANY]"**

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Thanks for connecting! I noticed [COMPANY] operates [SPECIFIC_EQUIPMENT/PROCESS] with [PLC_TYPE] systems. 

Quick question: How many alarms does your team deal with on a typical shift? Most maintenance managers I talk to say "too many to count" and their operators are experiencing serious alarm fatigue.

Here's what I'm seeing across [INDUSTRY] plants:
• 200+ daily alarms, 85% are nuisance
• Senior operators burning out from constant interruptions
• Knowledge walking out the door when experienced staff retire

We've helped similar [INDUSTRY] operations reduce alarm fatigue by 70% in the first 30 days. Our AI learns from your team's responses and captures the tribal knowledge before it's lost.

**Recent win:** [SIMILAR_COMPANY] prevented 3 major shutdowns by catching patterns their operators missed.

Worth a 15-minute conversation? I'm offering a free 30-day pilot to the right plant.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

### InMail 2: Value-Add Follow-up (1 week later)

**Subject: "Unplanned downtime study + [COMPANY] insights"**

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Came across this stat from Schneider Electric's latest study:

**"Unplanned downtime costs manufacturers $50K/hour, and 80% of incidents were predictable from alarm patterns."**

Got me thinking about our conversation on alarm management at [COMPANY].

The frustrating part? Most plants already have the data to prevent these shutdowns – it's just buried in logs nobody has time to analyze.

**Quick question:** What was [COMPANY]'s longest unplanned shutdown in the last 6 months? If it was more than a few hours, this might be worth millions.

Still offering that free 30-day pilot if you're interested in seeing what your alarm data could tell you.

[YOUR_NAME]

### InMail 3: Final Attempt (1 week later)

**Subject: "Last note on reducing alarm fatigue"**

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I know you're busy keeping [COMPANY] running smoothly, so I'll keep this brief.

I've reached out about helping reduce alarm fatigue and capture tribal knowledge before your senior operators retire. Since I haven't heard back, I'm guessing it's either not a priority or not the right timing.

No problem at all – I'll stop reaching out.

But if alarm management ever becomes a critical issue, just message me back. The 30-day pilot offer stands.

Keep those lines running!

[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. Here's a case study from [SIMILAR_COMPANY] – similar size and industry to yours. No forms, just results: [LINK]

## LINKEDIN CONTENT ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES

### When They Post About:

#### Equipment Issues
**"Great post, [FIRST_NAME]! We see this exact scenario all the time in [INDUSTRY]. The key is usually in the alarm patterns leading up to the failure. Most plants have this data but don't know how to interpret it. Would be happy to share some insights if helpful."**

#### Team/Hiring Challenges
**"Couldn't agree more about finding good maintenance people. The tribal knowledge gap is real. Have you found any good ways to capture what your senior operators know before they retire? It's become a huge focus in our industry."**

#### Plant Shutdowns/Downtime
**"Sorry to hear about the downtime. These unexpected shutdowns are killer for [INDUSTRY] operations. In our experience, about 80% of these events have warning signs in the alarm data 24-48 hours before. Hindsight is 20/20, but the patterns are usually there."**
