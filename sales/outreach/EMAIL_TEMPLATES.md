## EMAIL 1: Initial Outreach

### Subject Line Options:
1. **"[COMPANY_NAME]: How we helped [SIMILAR_COMPANY] reduce alarm fatigue by 70%"**
2. **"Quick question about your Allen-Bradley alarm management, [FIRST_NAME]"**
3. **"[COMPANY_NAME] - Are your operators drowning in nuisance alarms?"**

### Email Body:

**Subject:** [Choose from above]

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I noticed [COMPANY_NAME] uses [SPECIFIC_PLC_TYPE] systems for your [SPECIFIC_PROCESS] operations. I'm reaching out because most maintenance managers in [INDUSTRY] tell me the same thing:

**"Our operators are drowning in alarms, and when our senior guys retire, we lose decades of tribal knowledge overnight."**

Sound familiar?

Here's what we've seen at similar [INDUSTRY] plants:
- 🚨 **Alarm fatigue:** Operators get 200+ alarms per day, 85% are nuisance
- 🧠 **Knowledge gap:** When Bob retires, his 30 years of "I know that sound" goes with him
- 💸 **Reactive cycles:** You're always fighting fires instead of preventing them

**What if your PLCs could actually teach your team?**

We've built an AI system that learns from your alarm patterns and senior operators' responses. Instead of just logging alarms, it captures the "why" behind every decision.

**Real results from [SIMILAR_COMPANY_SIZE] [INDUSTRY] plant:**
- 70% reduction in nuisance alarms in first 30 days
- New operators performing like 5-year veterans within weeks
- Prevented 3 major shutdowns by catching patterns human eyes missed

[FIRST_NAME], I'd like to offer [COMPANY_NAME] a **free 30-day pilot** on one of your critical production lines. No commitment, no sales pitch – just results.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

Best regards,

P.S. If [SPECIFIC_PAIN] is keeping you up at night, this conversation could change that.

## EMAIL 2: Follow-up (Day 3)

### Subject Line:
**"Re: [Original subject] + Plant downtime costs $50K/hour (study)"**

### Email Body:

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I sent a note earlier about reducing alarm fatigue at [COMPANY_NAME]. Wasn't sure if it got lost in your inbox – I know how crazy maintenance schedules can be.

I came across this study from Schneider Electric that caught my attention:

**"Unplanned downtime costs manufacturing plants an average of $50,000 per hour, and 80% of incidents were predictable from alarm patterns."**

The crazy part? Most plants have all the data they need to prevent these shutdowns – it's just buried in alarm logs that nobody has time to analyze.

That's exactly what our AI does. It finds the patterns that predict problems before they become emergencies.

**Quick question:** What's the longest unplanned shutdown [COMPANY_NAME] has had in the last 6 months? If it's more than a few hours, this conversation could be worth millions.

Would next Tuesday or Wednesday work for a brief call?

## EMAIL 3: Break-up (Day 7)

### Subject Line:
**"Closing the loop on [COMPANY_NAME]'s alarm management"**

### Email Body:

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I've reached out a couple times about helping [COMPANY_NAME] tackle alarm fatigue and knowledge transfer challenges. Since I haven't heard back, I'm guessing either:

1. You're swamped (totally get it – maintenance never sleeps)
2. This isn't a priority right now
3. My emails aren't hitting the mark

Whatever the reason, no worries at all.

I'll stop reaching out and leave you in peace. But if alarm fatigue or tribal knowledge loss ever becomes a burning issue for [COMPANY_NAME], just reply to this email. 

The 30-day pilot offer stands whenever you're ready.

Keep those lines running smoothly,

[YOUR_NAME]  
[PHONE] | [EMAIL]
