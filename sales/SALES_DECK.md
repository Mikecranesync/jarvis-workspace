### FactoryLM
# AI-POWERED MAINTENANCE INTELLIGENCE

**The Digital Twin Platform for Industrial Operations**

*Transform your maintenance team from reactive firefighters to predictive problem-solvers*

---

#### Speaker Notes:
- Welcome everyone to FactoryLM - the future of industrial maintenance
- We're not just another software tool - we're a complete transformation of how maintenance gets done
- Today I'll show you how AI can turn your maintenance chaos into competitive advantage
- By the end of this presentation, you'll see exactly how we can cut your downtime costs by 40% or more

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### YOUR MAINTENANCE TEAM IS DROWNING

- **🚨 ALARM OVERLOAD** - 1000s of alerts, 90% false positives
- **📚 SCATTERED KNOWLEDGE** - Manuals everywhere, nowhere to be found
- **🧠 WALKING WISDOM** - When Bob retires, 20 years of knowledge walks out the door
- **⏰ REACTIVE MODE** - Always putting out fires, never preventing them

#### *Sound familiar?*

---

#### Speaker Notes:
- This is the reality for 95% of industrial facilities today
- Your best technicians spend more time hunting for information than fixing problems
- Every time an alarm goes off, it's a guessing game - is this critical or can we ignore it?
- The tribal knowledge problem is getting worse as baby boomers retire
- Ask the audience: "How many of you have technicians who've been there 20+ years?" Then: "How many are planning to retire in the next 5 years?"

---

## Slide 3: The Cost

### THE REAL PRICE OF REACTIVE MAINTENANCE

- **$260,000/hour** - Average cost of unplanned downtime
- **430,000** - Skilled technician shortage by 2028
- **$50 billion** - Annual cost of maintenance inefficiency (US manufacturing)
- **40%** - Time technicians waste hunting for information

#### *Every minute of downtime is money bleeding out*

---

#### Speaker Notes:
- These aren't just statistics - they're your P&L line items
- That $260K/hour? That's conservative. For some industries it's $1M+
- The technician shortage isn't getting better - Gen Z doesn't dream of fixing factory equipment
- But here's the thing - 40% of your maintenance budget goes to inefficiency you can fix TODAY
- "What's one hour of downtime cost YOUR facility?" (pause for effect)
