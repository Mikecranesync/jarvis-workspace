## 🏭 About the Customer

**Company:** ACME Automotive - Global automotive manufacturer specializing in electric and hybrid vehicle components  
**Industry:** Automotive Manufacturing / EV Components  
**Scale:** 15,000+ employees globally, 12 manufacturing facilities, producing 2.5M components annually  
**Operations:** High-precision manufacturing of battery systems, electric motors, and powertrain components with 24/7 production schedules

**Pre-FactoryLM Challenges:**
- Reactive maintenance approach causing unexpected downtime during critical production runs
- Alarm fatigue with 200+ daily alerts across production lines, leading to delayed responses
- Inconsistent troubleshooting approaches between shift technicians resulting in extended repair times

---

## 🚨 The Challenge

### Reactive Maintenance Crippling Production Efficiency

ACME's Texas facility was struggling with an outdated maintenance approach that relied heavily on reactive responses to equipment failures. With increasing production demands for their new EV battery line, unplanned downtime was becoming critically expensive.

**Pain Points:**
- **Unpredictable Equipment Failures:** Critical production equipment would fail without warning, causing cascade failures across interconnected systems
- **Information Overload:** Technicians received 200+ alarms daily with no prioritization, leading to critical issues being missed in the noise
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Retiring senior technicians were taking decades of troubleshooting expertise with them, leaving newer staff struggling with complex repairs

**Business Impact Before FactoryLM:**
- Average MTTR: 4.2 hours
- Alarm response time: 18 minutes average
- Technician efficiency: Only 60% of repairs completed on first attempt
- Annual maintenance costs: $8.5M including downtime losses
- Production line availability: 78% (well below industry benchmark of 85%+)

> **"We were constantly firefighting. Our best technicians spent more time running between alarms than actually fixing problems. The reactive approach was unsustainable."**  
> *— Sarah Martinez, Maintenance Manager, ACME Automotive*
