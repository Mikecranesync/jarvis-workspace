# 🏭 Dad & Son Conveyor Build Guide

**Build Time: ~2 hours**

## What We're Building

A real working conveyor belt! When we're done, the motor will spin the rollers and move stuff across the belt - just like at a factory or airport baggage claim.

## Step 1: Build the Frame Box 📦

**What you're making:** A rectangle like a picture frame

**Do this:**
1. Lay your two 48" boards on the ground, parallel like train tracks
2. Space them 14" apart (measure inside edge to inside edge)
3. Put a 14" board across each end
4. Pre-drill, then put 2 screws through each corner (makes an X pattern)
5. Add 2 more 14" boards in the middle for strength

**Check:** Does it look like a ladder? ✅

## Step 2: Add the Legs 🦵

**What you're making:** Turn your flat frame into a table

**Do this:**
1. Flip the frame upside down
2. Put a 30" leg at each corner (on the OUTSIDE of the frame)
3. Pre-drill, then use 2 screws per leg
4. Flip it right-side up
5. Check if it wobbles - adjust legs until it sits flat

**Check:** Is it about waist-high and doesn't wobble? ✅

---

## Step 3: Make the Rollers 🎢

**What you're making:** Spinny tubes that the belt wraps around

**Do this:**
1. Take a 16" dowel
2. Slide the 14" PVC pipe over it (dowel sticks out 1" on each side)
3. Drill a tiny hole through the PVC into the dowel
4. Put a small screw in so they spin together
5. **Make 2 of these!** (one for each end)

**Check:** Does it spin freely when you hold the dowel ends? ✅

---

## Step 4: Mount the Rollers 🔩

**What you're making:** Putting the rollers in the frame so they can spin

**Do this:**
1. At each short end of the frame, cut a U-shaped notch in the cross brace
2. Make the notch just big enough for the dowel to sit in and spin
3. Set each roller in place - dowel ends sit in the notches
4. Screw small wood blocks above each notch to keep roller from popping out
5. Spin by hand to make sure they turn freely!

**Check:** Both rollers spin easily without falling out? ✅

---

## Step 5: Motor Mount Platform 🏗️

**What you're making:** A place to bolt the motor

**Do this:**
1. Take your 12"x12" plywood square
2. Screw it to the END of the frame (pick either end - this is the "drive end")
3. Position it so the motor shaft will line up with the roller
4. Use 4 screws, one in each corner

**Check:** Is the plywood sturdy and doesn't wiggle? ✅

---

## Step 6: Put On the Belt 🎀

**What you're making:** The moving surface that carries stuff

**Do this:**
1. Lay your 6" wide rubber mat on top of both rollers
2. Wrap it around underneath
3. Pull it snug (not super tight, just no sag)
4. Overlap the ends by 2-3 inches
5. Staple the overlap together OR use contact cement to glue it

**Check:** When you spin a roller by hand, does the belt move? ✅

---

## Step 7: Wire It Up ⚡

**⚠️ ADULT ONLY - Dad does this part!**

**What you're making:** Connecting power to make it spin

**Do this:**
1. Mount the motor to the plywood platform
2. Connect motor shaft to the drive roller (pulley+belt or direct)
3. Wire VFD input to wall power
4. Wire VFD output to motor
5. Double-check all connections!
6. Turn on SLOWLY - start at lowest speed

**Check:** DOES IT SPIN?! 🎉

## 🎬 You Did It!

Your conveyor should now:
- ✅ Spin when you turn on the VFD
- ✅ Move things placed on the belt
- ✅ Change speed with the VFD dial
- ✅ Look awesome!

**Take a video!** 📱 This is going in the YC demo!

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Belt slips | Tighten it by moving tail roller back |
| Wobbles | Check legs are even, add bracing |
| Won't spin | Check motor wiring, VFD settings |
| Belt goes crooked | Adjust roller alignment |

---

## Safety Rules 🛑

1. **Unplug before adjusting anything**
2. **Keep fingers away from rollers when running**
3. **Start at slow speed first**
4. **Wear safety glasses when drilling/cutting**
