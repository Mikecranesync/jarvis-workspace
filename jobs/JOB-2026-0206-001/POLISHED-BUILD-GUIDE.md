# 🏭 Dad & Son Conveyor Build Guide

## What We're Building

A real working conveyor belt for the YC demo! When we're done, the motor will spin the rollers and move stuff across the belt - just like at a factory.

## Step 1: Build the Frame 📦
*Time: 30 minutes*

**You're making:** A rectangle like a picture frame

1. Lay your two 48" boards parallel, like train tracks
2. Space them exactly **14 inches apart** (inside to inside)
3. Put a 14" board across each end
4. **Pre-drill holes** (prevents splitting!)
5. Drive 2 screws through each corner
6. Add 2 more 14" braces in the middle

**✅ Check:** Does it look like a ladder? Is it square?

---

## Step 2: Add the Legs 🦵
*Time: 15 minutes*

**You're making:** Turn your flat frame into a table

1. Flip the frame upside down
2. Put a 30" leg at each corner (on the OUTSIDE)
3. Pre-drill, then use 2 screws per leg
4. Flip it right-side up

**✅ Check:** Is it about waist-high (36")? Does it wobble?

---

## Step 3: Make the Rollers 🎢
*Time: 20 minutes*

**You're making:** Spinny tubes that the belt wraps around

1. Take a 16" dowel
2. Slide the 14" PVC pipe over it
3. Center it - dowel sticks out **1 inch on each side**
4. Drill a small pilot hole through PVC into dowel
5. Put a #8 screw in so they spin together
6. **Make 2 of these!**

**✅ Check:** Does it spin freely when you hold the dowel ends?

---

## Step 4: Mount the Rollers 🔩
*Time: 15 minutes*

**You're making:** Putting rollers in the frame so they can spin

1. At each short end, cut a **U-notch** in the cross brace
2. Notch size: **1.25" wide x 0.5" deep**
3. Make notch snug but let roller spin freely
4. Set each roller in place
5. Screw small wood blocks above to keep roller from popping out

**✅ Check:** Both rollers spin easily without falling out?

---

## Step 5: Motor Mount 🏗️
*Time: 15 minutes*

**You're making:** A place to bolt the motor

1. Take your 12"x12" plywood square
2. Screw it to the end of the frame (this is the "drive end")
3. Position so motor shaft lines up with roller
4. Use 4 screws, one in each corner

**✅ Check:** Is the plywood sturdy?

---

## Step 6: Install Belt 🎀
*Time: 10 minutes*

**You're making:** The moving surface

1. Lay your 6" wide rubber mat on top of both rollers
2. Wrap it around underneath
3. Pull snug (not super tight)
4. Overlap ends by 2-3 inches
5. Staple or glue the overlap

**✅ Check:** Spin a roller by hand - does the belt move?

---

## Step 7: Wire & Test ⚡
*Time: 30 minutes*

**⚠️ ADULT ONLY - Dad does this part!**

1. Mount motor to the plywood platform
2. Connect motor shaft to drive roller
3. Wire VFD input to power
4. Wire VFD output to motor
5. Double-check all connections!
6. **Start at LOW speed first!**

**✅ Check:** DOES IT SPIN?! 🎉

---

## 🎬 Done! Take a Video!

Your conveyor should now:
- ✅ Spin when VFD is on
- ✅ Move things placed on the belt  
- ✅ Change speed with VFD dial
- ✅ Look awesome!

**📱 Film it running for the YC demo!**

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Belt slips | Tighten by moving tail roller back |
| Wobbles | Check legs are even, add bracing |
| Won't spin | Check motor wiring, VFD settings |
| Belt tracks crooked | Adjust roller alignment |

---

## Safety Rules 🛑

1. **Unplug before adjusting anything**
2. **Keep fingers away from rollers when running**
3. **Start at slow speed first**
4. **Wear safety glasses when drilling**
