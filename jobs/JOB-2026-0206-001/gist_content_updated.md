# 🏭 Dad & Son Conveyor Build Guide

**Build Time:** ~2 hours  
**Skill Level:** Beginner (perfect for father-son project!)

## What We're Building

A real working conveyor belt system! When finished, it will move objects across a rubber belt - just like at airports or factories. Perfect for your YC demo!

**Key measurements:**
- 48" long (outside of frame)
- 14" wide (inside space for belt)
- Use 2x4 lumber for all frame pieces
- Pre-drill holes before screwing to prevent splitting

**Key measurements:**
- 30" tall legs (perfect working height)
- Rollers at each end to support the belt
- Motor mount on left side (the "drive" end)
- Belt wraps around both rollers

**How to build:**
1. Take a 16" wooden dowel (1" thick)
2. Slide 14" PVC pipe over the dowel  
3. Dowel sticks out 1" on each side
4. Drill a small hole and screw them together so they spin as one piece
5. The dowel ends sit in U-shaped notches cut in the frame

## 🔧 Build Steps (Simple Version)

### Step 1: Cut the Wood
Cut your 2x4 lumber into these pieces:
- 2 pieces at 48" (side rails)
- 4 pieces at 14" (cross braces) 
- 4 pieces at 30" (legs)

### Step 2: Build the Frame
1. Lay the 48" boards parallel, 14" apart
2. Put the 14" boards across the ends to make a rectangle
3. Add 2 more 14" boards in the middle for strength
4. Screw everything together (2 screws per corner)

### Step 3: Add the Legs  
1. Flip frame upside down
2. Screw a 30" leg at each corner
3. Flip back right-side up
4. Check that it doesn't wobble

### Step 4: Make the Rollers
1. Slide PVC pipe onto dowel (centered, with 1" sticking out each end)
2. Drill small hole through PVC into dowel
3. Put in a screw so they turn together
4. Make 2 of these

### Step 5: Install Rollers
1. Cut U-shaped notches in the end cross-braces
2. Set rollers in the notches
3. Make sure they spin freely

### Step 6: Add Motor Mount & Belt
1. Screw the 12"×12" plywood to one end
2. Wrap rubber belt around both rollers
3. Overlap the ends and glue or staple together

## ⚡ Adding the Motor (Adult Step)

⚠️ **Safety:** This step requires electrical knowledge - adults only!

1. Mount motor to the plywood platform
2. Connect motor to VFD (Variable Frequency Drive)
3. Wire VFD to power supply
4. Test at low speed first!
