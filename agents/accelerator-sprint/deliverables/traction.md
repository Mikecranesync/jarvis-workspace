# Current Traction Summary

## Technical Milestones

**Working Prototype:** Full integration with Allen-Bradley Micro820 PLCs, the most common industrial controller in small-medium factories. Our AI copilot successfully reads native sensor data, processes it through local LLMs, and provides real-time maintenance guidance.

**Edge Infrastructure:** Deployed edge device v2.0 with automatic network detection and seamless PLC communication. Full Modbus TCP integration allows us to connect to 90% of existing industrial equipment without hardware modifications.

**Production System:** Live CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) processing real factory data and generating actionable insights for maintenance teams.

## Development Velocity

**9 days, 9,554 messages** of documented human-AI collaboration building FactoryLM. This represents the fastest industrial AI development cycle we've seen, with real-time iteration between domain expertise and technical execution.

**4-Layer Architecture Validated:** Successfully demonstrated intelligence flow from cloud insights down to deterministic PLC code, proving our core thesis that AI knowledge can be converted into permanent factory automation.

## Market Validation

**YouTube Channel (Industrial Skills Hub):** Building audience of maintenance technicians and automation professionals who represent our target users.

**Industry Recognition:** Direct engagement with industrial automation community validating both the problem (expensive, external monitoring) and our solution approach (internal PLC integration).

## Next 90 Days

- Beta deployment in 3 partner factories
- Allen-Bradley ControlLogix integration (enterprise PLCs)
- First customer paying $30/device/month
- 50 edge devices manufactured and deployed

The fundamentals are proven. Now we scale from prototype to production.
