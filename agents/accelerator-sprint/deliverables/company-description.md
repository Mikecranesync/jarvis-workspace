# Company Description (200 words)

FactoryLM puts AI directly inside PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) — the brain of every factory machine. Unlike $500K+ solutions from Augury and Uptake that monitor factories from the outside, we integrate with the control layer itself for $30/device/month.

Our AI copilot reads sensor data natively, predicts equipment failures, and guides maintenance technicians through repairs in real-time. When a pump starts vibrating abnormally, our system doesn't just send an alert — it walks the technician through the exact fix, learns from the outcome, and converts that knowledge into deterministic code for future incidents.

The industrial automation market is worth $91B annually, with 95% of factories still running on reactive maintenance. Current solutions require expensive sensor installations and external monitoring systems. We leverage existing PLC infrastructure, making AI-powered predictive maintenance accessible to every factory, not just Fortune 500 companies.

We have a working prototype on Allen-Bradley Micro820 PLCs with full Modbus TCP integration. Our 4-layer architecture flows intelligence downward: from cloud insights to local models to edge devices to deterministic code. This recursive learning approach turns maintenance technicians into experts and transforms reactive factories into predictive ones.

The PLC is the brain. If you want AI to actually help, it needs to be IN the brain.
