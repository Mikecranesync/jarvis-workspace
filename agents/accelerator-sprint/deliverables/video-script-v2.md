## FULL SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:12 | THE 3AM CRISIS HOOK
**MIKE SAYS:** *(looking directly at camera, urgent but controlled)*
"At 3 AM Tuesday, my phone buzzed. 'Production line's down, bleeding $50K an hour, and nobody knows why.' I drove to the factory in my pajamas, stared at a PLC panel full of error codes, and realized: this machine knows exactly what's wrong, but can't tell us."

**ON SCREEN:** Phone buzzing at 3 AM → Mike driving in dark → Factory floor chaos, alarms blaring → Close-up of confused technician at PLC display

---

### 0:12-0:22 | CREDIBILITY + THE INSIGHT  
**MIKE SAYS:**
"I'm Mike Crane, 15 years programming these machines. Here's what Augury and Uptake miss with their $500K sensor networks: PLCs already have perfect diagnostic data. We don't add sensors. We plug directly into the brain."

**ON SCREEN:** Mike in front of PLC cabinet → Split screen: External sensors vs FactoryLM Edge device connecting directly to PLC → Data flowing from PLC to FactoryLM

---

### 0:22-0:37 | SOLUTION + LIVE PREDICTION MAGIC
**MIKE SAYS:**
"FactoryLM lives inside the PLC and predicts failures before they happen. Watch this."
*(pause for demo)*
"Bearing temperature rising... AI detects failure pattern... Maintenance alert: Replace bearing in next 4 hours to prevent $50K breakdown."

**ON SCREEN:** FactoryLM Edge device connected to PLC → Live sensor data streaming → AI analysis happening → Phone notification: "PREDICTION: Bearing failure in 4 hours" → Step-by-step repair guide on screen

---

### 0:37-0:48 | TRACTION PROOF
**MIKE SAYS:**
"Working prototype on Allen-Bradley PLCs. $30 per month per device versus $500K enterprise solutions. We've processed 9,554 real maintenance conversations. Every breakdown teaches the AI to predict the next one."

**ON SCREEN:** Micro820 PLC with FactoryLM connected → Price comparison graphic: "$30/month vs $500,000" → Live chat showing AI guiding technician through repair → Success metrics counter

---

### 0:48-0:60 | COMPETITIVE MOAT + URGENT ASK
**MIKE SAYS:**
"Siemens, Rockwell, Uptake - they're all locked into external sensor networks. We read native PLC data they can't touch. That's our moat. But we need to move fast. $500K locks in our first 10 factories before someone figures out what we're doing."

**ON SCREEN:** Competitor logos with "External Only" label → FactoryLM "Inside the Brain" graphic → Clock ticking → Mike looking directly at camera → FactoryLM logo + "AI Inside the PLC"

## DELIVERY NOTES

### Mike's Energy & Tone
- **0:00-0:12:** Urgent storytelling - relive the 3 AM crisis
- **0:12-0:22:** Confident authority - "Here's what everyone misses"
- **0:22-0:37:** Excited demonstration - "Watch this" + magic moment
- **0:37-0:48:** Proud of traction - specific numbers hit hard
- **0:48-0:60:** Competitive intensity - "we need to move fast"

### Key Phrases to Hit EXTRA HARD
- **"3 AM"** - everyone relates to emergency calls
- **"this machine knows exactly what's wrong"** - the core insight
- **"We plug directly into the brain"** - competitive advantage
- **"predicts failures BEFORE they happen"** - the magic
- **"$30 versus $500K"** - pause for dramatic effect
- **"they can't touch"** - why we win
- **"before someone figures out what we're doing"** - urgency/FOMO

### The Magic Demo Moment (0:27-0:33)
This 6-second sequence needs to be **flawless**:
1. Show live sensor reading rising
2. AI pattern recognition activating  
3. Phone notification appearing: "PREDICTION: Bearing failure in 4 hours"
4. This is the "holy sh*t" moment that wins investors

### Technical Setup
- **Camera:** Eye level, rule of thirds framing
- **Lighting:** Soft, professional - no harsh shadows
- **Audio:** Crystal clear - lapel mic preferred
- **Background:** PLC cabinet or industrial setting
- **Props:** Phone with FactoryLM app ready for demo

## COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION EMPHASIS

### Why This Script Beats V1:

1. **EMOTIONAL HOOK:** 3 AM crisis call vs generic "factories lose millions"
2. **PREDICTION POWER:** Shows AI preventing failures vs just diagnosing them  
3. **NAMED COMPETITORS:** Augury, Uptake, Siemens, Rockwell with specific pricing
4. **URGENCY ENDING:** "Before someone figures out" vs weak "$500K ask"
5. **CLEAR MOAT:** "Native PLC data they can't touch" - crystal clear advantage

### Investor Fear Factors:
- Fear of missing the next unicorn (DoorDash/Airbnb scale)
- Fear of competitors moving faster ("we need to move fast")
- Fear of not understanding the technical moat until too late

---

## ONE-TAKE BACKUP PLAN

If B-roll isn't available, record Mike straight to camera:
- **Props:** FactoryLM Edge device, PLC, phone with app
- **Demo:** Show device connecting, phone responding
- **Graphics:** Overlay competitor names, prices, prediction alerts
- **Energy:** Higher energy to compensate for no visual breaks

---

## SUCCESS CHECKLIST

After recording, verify:
- [ ] 3 AM story hooks audience in first 10 seconds
- [ ] AI prediction demo creates "magic moment"
- [ ] Competitors named with specific prices ($500K)
- [ ] Ending creates urgency and FOMO
- [ ] Under 60 seconds spoken (time the script read-through)
- [ ] Mike's passion for the problem shows through
- [ ] Clear why FactoryLM wins vs everyone else

**REMEMBER:** This isn't just explaining what we do - it's making investors afraid they'll miss the next DoorDash if they don't fund us immediately.
