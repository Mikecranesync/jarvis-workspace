# Founder Story: Why Mike is Uniquely Qualified

## Living the Problem

For 15+ years, Mike Crane has been the guy factories call when their million-dollar machines break down. As an industrial automation specialist and PLC programmer, he's spent countless nights troubleshooting failed pumps, diagnosing conveyor issues, and training maintenance teams who struggle with increasingly complex systems.

He's watched companies spend $500K on external monitoring solutions that still couldn't prevent the 3 AM emergency calls. He's seen brilliant technicians retire, taking decades of troubleshooting knowledge with them. He's experienced firsthand how reactive maintenance burns through budgets and crushes operational efficiency.

## The "Aha" Moment

"The PLC already knows everything," Mike realized during a particularly frustrating breakdown. "Temperature, pressure, motor speed, valve position — all the data we need is already there. We just need to teach it to think about what that data means."

While others built external monitoring systems, Mike saw the real opportunity: putting AI directly inside the brain of every factory machine. Not watching from outside, but integrating with the control layer itself.

## Domain Authority

**Technical Depth:** Mike doesn't just understand PLCs — he programs them. He knows Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagrams, and Structured Text. He's configured Modbus networks, integrated HMIs, and debugged industrial communication protocols. This isn't theoretical knowledge; it's hands-on expertise gained from solving real factory problems.

**Industry Credibility:** Maintenance managers trust Mike because he's been in their shoes. When he says "I've seen this failure pattern before," it's backed by 15 years of emergency repairs and system optimizations.

**Customer Intimacy:** Mike understands the economic reality of industrial maintenance. Every minute of downtime costs money. Solutions must work reliably in harsh environments with minimal training. Pretty dashboards don't matter if they can't prevent failures.

## Building the Future

Mike didn't just identify the problem — he built the solution. His working prototype on Allen-Bradley Micro820 proves that AI can live inside PLCs and provide real value to maintenance teams. He's demonstrated the complete vision: from sensor data to AI insights to deterministic code.

**The unfair advantage:** Most AI companies try to learn industrial automation. Mike starts with 15 years of industrial automation expertise and adds AI to solve problems he's personally experienced.

When factories see FactoryLM, they don't see another tech demo. They see a solution built by someone who understands their pain and has the domain expertise to solve it.

Mike isn't building FactoryLM because he can. He's building it because he must — because he knows exactly how transformative this technology can be for every factory that's still playing the expensive game of "fix it when it breaks."
