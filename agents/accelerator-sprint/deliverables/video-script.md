# YC Video Script - 60 Seconds

**Total Runtime:** 60 seconds exactly
**Format:** Mike talking to camera with strategic B-roll cuts

## FULL SCRIPT

### 0:00-0:10 | The Problem Hook
**MIKE SAYS:** *(looking directly at camera, confident but not slick)*
"Factories lose millions to unplanned downtime every year. A pump fails, production stops, and suddenly you're burning $50,000 an hour while some tech Googles error codes."

**ON SCREEN:** Factory floor establishing shot → flashing red alarm light → frustrated maintenance worker staring at PLC panel

---

### 0:10-0:20 | Credibility + Problem Depth  
**MIKE SAYS:**
"I'm Mike Crane. I've spent 15 years programming PLCs and getting 3 AM calls when million-dollar machines break down. The problem isn't lack of data — every PLC already collects everything."

**ON SCREEN:** Mike in front of PLC cabinet → close-up of PLC display with scrolling data → hands typing on industrial HMI

---

### 0:20-0:30 | Solution (The Big Insight)
**MIKE SAYS:**
"The problem is that data stays trapped inside proprietary systems. So we built FactoryLM — AI that lives *inside* the PLC, not watching from outside like our competitors."

**ON SCREEN:** FactoryLM Edge device plugging into PLC → split screen showing external sensors vs. internal PLC connection → Telegram interface with AI chat

---

### 0:30-0:40 | How It Works
**MIKE SAYS:**
"We read native sensor data, predict failures, and guide technicians through exact repairs. Every fix makes the system smarter. When AI knowledge becomes PLC code, you don't need the AI anymore."

**ON SCREEN:** Live sensor data streaming → AI providing step-by-step repair instructions on phone → technician following guidance → "FIXED" notification

---

### 0:40-0:50 | Traction Proof
**MIKE SAYS:**
"We've got a working prototype on Allen-Bradley PLCs. Full integration, $30/device/month versus $500K for enterprise solutions. 9 days, 9,554 messages of human-AI collaboration got us here."

**ON SCREEN:** Micro820 PLC connected to Edge device → live demo of AI responding to sensor changes → price comparison graphic ($30 vs. $500K)

---

### 0:50-0:60 | The Ask
**MIKE SAYS:**
"The big players can't do this because they're locked into external sensors. We're inside the brain. That's the moat. I need $500K to deploy to our first 10 factories."

**ON SCREEN:** Mike looking directly at camera → FactoryLM logo with "AI Inside the PLC" tagline

## DELIVERY NOTES

### Mike's Energy & Tone
- **Confident but not cocky** — you've solved real problems for real factories
- **Passionate but controlled** — this isn't theoretical, it's personal
- **Direct eye contact** — talk to one person, not a crowd
- **Conversational pace** — not rushed, but urgent
- **Authentic pauses** — let the big insights land

### Key Phrases to Hit Hard
- "AI that lives *inside* the PLC" (emphasize "inside")
- "$30 a month versus $500K" (pause for contrast)
- "We're inside the brain" (the moat)
- "9,554 messages" (specific proof of velocity)

### Technical Setup
- **Camera:** Phone or DSLR at eye level, not looking up/down
- **Lighting:** Natural window light or soft LED panel
- **Audio:** Lapel mic or very quiet room — NO echo/reverb
- **Background:** PLC cabinet ideal, industrial setting preferred
- **Framing:** Head and shoulders, rule of thirds

### If B-roll Isn't Available
Record Mike talking straight to camera for 60 seconds. Authenticity beats production value for YC. Use graphics/text overlays for key points instead of B-roll.

## BACKUP: Phone-Only Recording Setup

1. **Portrait mode** (vertical) — most authentic for founder videos
2. **Good lighting** on face
3. **Stable hand** or phone stand
4. **One take** — don't over-polish
5. **End with clear ask** — "Let's talk"

*Remember: YC wants to see the founder, not a commercial. This is Mike's story, told in Mike's voice, about a problem Mike lived and a solution Mike built.*
