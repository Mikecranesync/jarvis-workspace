## SCRIPT

### Opening (0-10 sec)
*[Mike, facing camera, in front of PLC/industrial setting]*

"I'm Mike Crane. I've spent 15 years in factories, and I've watched the same problem destroy production lines over and over: when the expert retires, the knowledge walks out the door."

### Problem (10-20 sec)
*[B-roll: Factory floor, PLC cabinet, maintenance tech looking frustrated]*

"Every factory runs on PLCs — these controllers that nobody understands except the guy who's been there 30 years. When he's gone, you're paying $50,000 an hour in downtime while Googling error codes."

### Solution (20-35 sec)
*[B-roll: FactoryLM Edge device, Telegram interface, live data]*

"FactoryLM puts AI directly inside the PLC — not watching from the cloud like our competitors, but actually reading the controller, predicting failures, and telling technicians exactly what to do."

*[Back to Mike]*

"Every fix makes the system smarter. Recursive learning. The more you use it, the more it knows."

### Traction (35-45 sec)
*[B-roll: Working prototype, Allen-Bradley Micro820, demo]*

"We've got a working prototype on Allen-Bradley PLCs. Edge device that auto-configures. $30 a month per device — versus $500K for the enterprise solutions."

### Close (45-60 sec)
*[Mike, direct to camera]*

"The big players can't do this because they're locked into sensors and cloud. We're inside the brain. That's the moat."

*[Beat]*

"I'm looking for $500K to deploy to our first 10 factories. Let's talk."

## FILMING TIPS

1. **Location:** In front of PLC cabinet or industrial equipment
2. **Lighting:** Natural light or soft LED, avoid harsh shadows
3. **Audio:** Lapel mic or quiet room, NO echo
4. **Framing:** Head and shoulders, rule of thirds
5. **Energy:** Confident but not salesy, passionate but not manic
6. **Eye contact:** Look at camera, not script
7. **One take:** Don't over-polish, authenticity matters
