## Competitive Landscape

| Company | Funding | Model | Price Point | Our Advantage |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Augury** | $300M | Sensors + cloud | $500K+ | We're inside PLC |
| **Uptake** | $250M | Data platform | $250K+ | We're edge-first |
| **Samsara** | $930M | Fleet/IoT | $300K+ | We're PLC-native |
| **Rockwell FactoryTalk** | N/A (Corp) | Suite | $100K+ | We're AI-native |
| **Siemens MindSphere** | N/A (Corp) | Platform | $200K+ | We're nimble |

### Why They Can't Pivot
- **Augury:** Hardware-locked to vibration sensors
- **Uptake:** No PLC expertise, pure software
- **Samsara:** Fleet-focused, manufacturing is afterthought
- **Rockwell/Siemens:** Legacy architecture, slow innovation
