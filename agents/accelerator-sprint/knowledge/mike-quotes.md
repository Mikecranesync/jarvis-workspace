## On the Problem

> "I've been the guy called at 2 AM when the production line goes down."

> "I've watched $50K/hour losses while waiting for a specialist who retired 3 years ago."

> "I've seen technicians Google error codes because the knowledge base is a filing cabinet from 1997."

> "Every factory manager I talk to says the same thing: 'I need to capture what my senior guys know before they leave.'"

---

## On the Solution

> "The PLC is the brain of every factory. If you want AI to actually help, it needs to be IN the brain, not watching from outside."

> "Unlike cloud-based solutions that monitor from the outside, we integrate directly with the control layer."

> "F*** yeah that's what I want. I thought that's what we were building from the start." (on auto-detection)

> "Intelligence flows DOWNWARD. Convert AI answers into code."

---

## On Competition

> "Augury is a sensor company. They sit OUTSIDE the control system. They can tell you something is wrong, but can't fix it."

> "We're not competing with Augury. We're doing something they literally cannot do."

> "They're locked into their architecture. $300M in funding means they can't pivot."

---

## On the Business

> "Hardware is customer acquisition; software subscription is the real revenue."

> "$30/device vs their $500K. That's not incremental improvement, that's a different market."

> "I want a freaking supercomputer in the cloud just for fun."

---

## On Building

> "Ship products, generate revenue. That's the mission."

> "We're in a race. Move fast."

> "Do it right, not just fast."

> "Update the README = Update the VISION. One source of truth."

## Founder Story Beats

1. **15+ years in factories** - Not a tech bro discovering manufacturing
2. **The 2 AM calls** - Real pain, not theoretical
3. **Veterans retiring** - Knowledge walking out the door
4. **Built the solution himself** - Working prototype exists
5. **AI-native from day 1** - Not bolting AI onto legacy software
