## Email 21: Did You Get In? (Day 66)

**Subject:** Did you get in? Here's your next step  
**Alt:** Quick check-in  
**Preview:** I noticed you haven't logged in yet

Hey {$name|there},

I see you haven't logged in yet, so I wanted to make sure nothing's blocking you.

**If you hit a snag:**  
Just reply and tell me what happened. I'll fix it personally.

**If you just haven't had time:**  
No worries. Here's the link again:

## Email 22: First 10 Minutes (Day 68)

**Subject:** 3 things to try in your first 10 minutes  
**Alt:** Get the most out of FactoryLM  
**Preview:** Start here

---

Hey {$name|there},

Now that you're in, here are the 3 things worth trying first:

**1. Ask a question in plain English**

Go to the Knowledge Search and type something like:
- "Why does Motor 7 trip after startup?"
- "What's the fix for VFD fault F0051?"
- "Show me all conveyor issues this month"

See what comes back.

**2. Upload a fault code**

Have a current issue? Upload a screenshot or type the code. Watch the AI work.

**3. Add one piece of knowledge**

After you solve something, add a note. Even one sentence:
- "Fixed by cleaning the sensor"
- "Replaced bearing, was making grinding noise"
- "False alarm — happens when humidity > 80%"

That's the foundation. Everything builds from there.

Have fun. And hit me up if you need anything.

## Email 23: Hidden Feature (Day 72)

**Subject:** The feature 80% of users miss  
**Alt:** Did you find this yet?  
**Preview:** Most people skip right past it

---

Hey {$name|there},

Most users dive into fault diagnosis (makes sense — that's the headline feature).

But there's something else 80% of people miss:

**The Pattern Finder.**

It's in the Insights tab. Here's what it does:

It looks at your fault history and finds:
- Recurring issues (same fault, different times)
- Correlated failures (A fails → B fails soon after)
- Time-based patterns (fails every Monday morning)

One user found that a pump always faulted 48 hours after a specific cleaning cycle. Turned out the cleaning chemicals were degrading a seal.

**Without the Pattern Finder?** That stays invisible.

Worth a look if you haven't explored it yet.

## Email 24: How's It Going? (Day 75)

**Subject:** How's it going? Reply and tell me  
**Alt:** Quick check-in from Mike  
**Preview:** I'm actually reading these

---

Hey {$name|there},

Quick check-in:

**How's FactoryLM working for you so far?**

I'm not looking for polished feedback. I want the real stuff:

- What's working?
- What's frustrating?
- What's missing?
- What made you go "oh, that's cool"?

Just reply to this email. I read every response personally.

This is how we make it better.

Thanks,  
Mike

## Email 25: Referral (Day 79)

**Subject:** Know someone who'd love this?  
**Alt:** Spread the word (if you want)  
**Preview:** Get them early access too

---

Hey {$name|there},

If you're getting value from FactoryLM, I have a favor to ask.

**Know someone who'd benefit?**

- A maintenance manager dealing with the same problems
- A reliability engineer who's tried everything
- A plant manager tired of tribal knowledge walking out

Send them here: **factorylm.com**

They'll get moved to the front of the waitlist.

No referral codes. No tracking. Just tell them to mention your name when they sign up, and I'll make sure they get in fast.

Thanks for spreading the word.

— Mike

## Email 27: From Skeptic to Believer (Day 85)

**Subject:** From skeptic to believer  
**Alt:** "I didn't think AI could help maintenance"  
**Preview:** Real story from a real user

---

Hey {$name|there},

I want to share a story from one of our early users.

---

*"I've been a maintenance tech for 28 years. When my plant manager said we were trying 'AI maintenance software,' I rolled my eyes.*

*Another tool that doesn't understand what I actually do. Another thing I have to update. Another vendor promise.*

*First day, I uploaded a fault code I'd been chasing for weeks. Intermittent. No pattern. Driving me crazy.*

*FactoryLM came back with: 'Similar fault at 3 other sites. In 2 cases, it was a grounding issue on the encoder cable. One case was a failing power supply.'*

*Checked the encoder cable. Loose ground. Fixed in 20 minutes.*

*I'm not a believer in AI. But I'm a believer in this."*

— Dave, Senior Maintenance Tech

---

That's why we build this.
