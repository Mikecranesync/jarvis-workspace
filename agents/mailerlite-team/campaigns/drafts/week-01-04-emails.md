## Email 1: Welcome (Day 1)

**Subject:** You're in — Welcome to FactoryLM  
**Preview:** Here's what happens next...

---

Hey {$name|there},

**You're in.** Welcome to FactoryLM.

We're building AI that actually understands industrial equipment — not generic chatbots pretending to know your plant.

**Here's what you're getting early access to:**

• **Smart Diagnostics** — Upload a PLC fault, get step-by-step fixes in seconds  
• **Knowledge Capture** — Your best technician's expertise, available to everyone  
• **Predictive Alerts** — Know what's failing before it fails  

We're rolling out access over the next few weeks. You'll be among the first to try it.

In the meantime, I'll send you some insights on where industrial maintenance is headed — and why the old way isn't cutting it anymore.

Talk soon,  
**Mike Harper**  
Founder, FactoryLM

*P.S. — Have a specific problem you're dealing with? Just reply to this email. I read every one.*

## Email 2: The $260K Problem (Day 3)

**Subject:** The $260K problem nobody talks about  
**Alt:** Why your best techs are your biggest risk  
**Preview:** And it's not equipment failure...

---

Hey {$name|there},

Here's a number that should scare you: **$260,000**.

That's the average cost when a senior maintenance tech retires — taking 30 years of tribal knowledge with them.

The new hire? They've got the degree, but they don't know:
- That Motor 7 always trips on humid days
- That the conveyor bearing sounds different before it fails
- That the "fix" in the manual doesn't actually work

**This is the problem we built FactoryLM to solve.**

Not by replacing your techs — by making sure their knowledge doesn't walk out the door.

Here's how it works:

1. **Capture** — Every diagnosis, every fix, every "I just know" moment gets logged
2. **Learn** — AI connects patterns humans miss
3. **Share** — New techs get answers from 30 years of experience on day one

We've seen plants cut training time by 60% and first-time fix rates jump by 40%.

Your early access is coming soon. I'll let you know the moment it's ready.

## Email 3: Ready to See It? (Day 7)

**Subject:** Ready to see what I've been building?  
**Alt:** Your early access is almost here  
**Preview:** Two years in the making...

---

Hey {$name|there},

For the last two years, I've been obsessed with one question:

*Why is industrial maintenance still stuck in the 1990s?*

Paper logs. Tribal knowledge. Techs driving 3 hours because nobody documented a fix.

**FactoryLM is my answer.**

It's an AI that actually speaks industrial — PLC faults, ladder logic, Modbus protocols. Not a generic chatbot with a hard hat emoji.

**Here's what you'll be able to do:**

✓ Upload a fault code, get a diagnosis in 60 seconds  
✓ Ask questions in plain English, get answers from your equipment data  
✓ Build a knowledge base that grows smarter with every repair  

I'm opening up early access soon.

You signed up early, so you'll be first in line.

Talk soon,  
**Mike**

*P.S. — No credit card, no commitment. Just early access to something I think you'll love.*

## Email 4: Why Your CMMS is Failing (Day 10)

**Subject:** Why your CMMS is failing you  
**Alt:** The dirty secret about maintenance software  
**Preview:** Hint: It's not the software's fault

---

Hey {$name|there},

Let me guess — you have a CMMS, but nobody uses it.

Or they do use it, but only to log work orders. Everything else? Spreadsheets. Sticky notes. "Ask Jim, he knows."

**Here's the dirty secret:** Most CMMS software was built for accountants, not technicians.

They track costs. They schedule PMs. They generate reports for people who never touch a wrench.

But they don't help a tech standing in front of a faulted drive at 2 AM figure out what's wrong.

**That's the gap we're filling.**

FactoryLM isn't a CMMS replacement — it's what your CMMS should have been from the start:

- **AI that understands your equipment** (not just asset tags)
- **Troubleshooting that actually troubleshoots** (not just links to 400-page manuals)
- **Knowledge that grows** (the more your team uses it, the smarter it gets)

We integrate with the CMMS you already have. No rip-and-replace.

More on that soon.

## Email 5: 3 Trends for 2026 (Day 14)

**Subject:** 3 trends reshaping maintenance in 2026  
**Alt:** What the next 12 months look like  
**Preview:** #2 is already happening at your competitors

---

Hey {$name|there},

I spend a lot of time talking to maintenance leaders. Here's what I'm seeing heading into 2026:

**1. AI goes from hype to helper**

Last year, everyone talked about AI. This year, the winners are actually using it.

Not for PowerPoint slides — for real work. Fault diagnostics. Predictive alerts. Knowledge search.

**2. The skills gap hits crisis mode**

The retirement wave isn't coming. It's here.

Plants that haven't captured tribal knowledge are scrambling. The ones that did? They're training new techs in months, not years.

**3. "Good enough" maintenance becomes too expensive**

With equipment costs up 20%+ and supply chains still unpredictable, unplanned downtime is no longer acceptable.

The bar for maintenance performance just got higher.

---

**Where does FactoryLM fit?**

We're built for all three:
- AI that's actually useful (not a demo)
- Knowledge capture that doesn't require a PhD
- Predictive insights that prevent problems

Your early access is coming. Keep an eye out.

## Email 6: AI Maintenance Assistant (Day 17)

**Subject:** Meet your AI maintenance assistant  
**Alt:** This is what $2M of R&D looks like  
**Preview:** It speaks PLC fluently

---

Hey {$name|there},

I want to introduce you to something we've been building for two years.

It's an AI that actually understands industrial equipment.

Not a chatbot trained on the internet. Not a wrapper around ChatGPT with some prompts.

**A purpose-built AI for maintenance.**

Here's what makes it different:

**It speaks your language**
- Allen-Bradley fault codes? It knows them.
- Modbus registers? It can read them.
- Ladder logic? It can analyze it.

**It learns from your plant**
- Every diagnosis makes it smarter
- Every fix gets captured
- Every pattern gets connected

**It works with your tech stack**
- Plugs into your CMMS
- Reads your historian
- Connects to your PLCs

We're not trying to replace your team. We're trying to give them superpowers.

More details coming soon. Wanted you to see what we're building.

## Email 7: 3-Hour to 3-Minute (Day 21)

**Subject:** From 3-hour diagnosis to 3 minutes  
**Alt:** How one plant cut diagnostic time by 95%  
**Preview:** Real story, real numbers

---

Hey {$name|there},

Quick story:

A food processing plant was losing $15,000/hour every time their main conveyor line went down.

The problem? Their senior tech retired. The new guy was good, but he didn't have 30 years of "I've seen this before."

Average diagnostic time: **3+ hours**.

They started capturing every fault, every diagnosis, every fix into FactoryLM.

Six months later:
- **3-minute average diagnostics** (AI pulls up similar faults instantly)
- **85% first-time fix rate** (up from 60%)
- **$400K saved** in reduced downtime

The new tech? He now performs like a 10-year veteran.

**That's the power of captured knowledge + AI.**

Not magic. Just every lesson learned, made searchable and smart.

We're getting close to opening early access. You're on the list.

— Mike

## Email 8: What Beta Users Say (Day 24)

**Subject:** What our beta users are saying  
**Alt:** Real feedback from real plants  
**Preview:** Unfiltered opinions

---

Hey {$name|there},

We've had a small group testing FactoryLM for the past few months.

I wanted to share some of their feedback — unfiltered:

---

**"Finally, software that doesn't make me want to throw my laptop."**  
— Maintenance Supervisor, Automotive Plant

---

**"My new guys are solving problems they shouldn't be able to solve yet."**  
— Plant Manager, Food & Beverage

---

**"I was skeptical about AI. This actually works."**  
— Senior Tech, 28 years experience

---

**"The knowledge capture alone is worth it. Everything else is bonus."**  
— Reliability Engineer, Chemical Processing

---

These aren't paid testimonials. These are people who've been burned by software promises before.

They're using it because it works.

Soon, you'll be able to see for yourself.

— Mike

*P.S. — If you have specific questions, just reply. I'm happy to answer.*

## Email 9: Why I Built This (Day 28)

**Subject:** Why I quit my job to build this  
**Alt:** The story behind FactoryLM  
**Preview:** It started with a $200K mistake

---

Hey {$name|there},

I want to tell you why I'm building FactoryLM.

Four years ago, I was running maintenance operations for a heavy equipment company. We had a good team. Good equipment. Good systems.

Then our best tech retired.

Within six months:
- Diagnostic times doubled
- First-time fix rates dropped 30%
- We had a $200K unplanned outage that he would have prevented

Everything he knew? Gone.

I looked for software to solve this. Couldn't find it.

So I started building it.

**FactoryLM is the tool I wish I'd had.**

Not another CMMS. Not another asset tracker. Something that actually helps technicians do their jobs — and captures what they know so it's never lost.

We're almost ready to open the doors.

Thanks for being on this journey with me.

— Mike
