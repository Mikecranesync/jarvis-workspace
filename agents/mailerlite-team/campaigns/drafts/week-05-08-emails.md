## Email 10: How AI Reads Fault Codes (Day 31)

**Subject:** How AI reads a PLC fault code  
**Alt:** Under the hood of FactoryLM  
**Preview:** Geek out with me for 2 minutes

---

Hey {$name|there},

I get asked a lot: "How does the AI actually work?"

Let me show you.

Say you get this fault: **Allen-Bradley 16#0004**

A human tech might:
1. Look it up in a 400-page manual
2. Find it's a "Module Rack Fault"
3. Still not know what to do

**Here's what FactoryLM does:**

1. Recognizes the fault code instantly
2. Pulls context: Which PLC? What was running? What happened before?
3. Searches your plant's history for similar faults
4. Checks manufacturer knowledge base
5. Returns: "Likely cause: Backplane connection on slot 3. Last three times this happened, reseating the module fixed it. Check torque on connector screws."

**Time: 8 seconds.**

That's not magic. It's:
- A database of every PLC fault code ever documented
- Your plant's own diagnostic history
- Pattern matching across thousands of similar faults

The more your team uses it, the smarter it gets for *your* equipment.

More coming soon.

## Email 11: VFD Diagnosis Demo (Day 35)

**Subject:** Watch: Diagnosing a VFD fault in 60 seconds  
**Alt:** See FactoryLM in action  
**Preview:** 60-second video inside

---

Hey {$name|there},

I recorded a quick demo I think you'll like.

**Scenario:** VFD throwing an overcurrent fault on a conveyor drive.

**What you'll see:**
- Upload the fault screenshot
- AI identifies the fault code
- Pulls up 3 similar cases from your plant history
- Suggests: "Check motor coupling — last 2 times this was a misalignment after bearing replacement"

**Total time: 60 seconds.**

[Watch the Demo →]

No sales pitch. Just the product doing what it does.

Let me know what you think.

— Mike

*P.S. — Want to try it yourself? Early access is opening soon.*

## Email 12: Tribal Knowledge Problem (Day 38)

**Subject:** Stop losing tribal knowledge  
**Alt:** Your best tech's brain, in a database  
**Preview:** Before they retire...

---

Hey {$name|there},

Here's a question: **What happens when your best tech retires?**

I'm not talking about the work orders. Those are documented.

I'm talking about:
- "That motor always sounds like that after a cold start"
- "The manual says replace it, but cleaning the contacts works"
- "When the pressure reads 45, it's actually 50 — sensor's off"

**That's tribal knowledge.** And in most plants, it walks out the door.

FactoryLM captures it automatically:

Every time a tech:
- Diagnoses a problem
- Solves a fault
- Adds a note
- Tries a fix

It goes into the system. Tagged. Searchable. Learnable.

When the next tech faces the same problem, they don't start from scratch. They start from 30 years of experience.

**That's how you break the retirement cycle.**

More on this coming soon.

## Email 13: The ROI Math (Day 42)

**Subject:** The math on technician turnover  
**Alt:** What knowledge loss actually costs  
**Preview:** It's worse than you think

---

Hey {$name|there},

Let's do some quick math.

**When a senior tech leaves:**

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Recruiting | $5,000-15,000 |
| Training (6-12 months) | $50,000-100,000 |
| Productivity loss during ramp | $75,000-150,000 |
| Mistakes/rework | $25,000-50,000 |
| **Total** | **$155,000-315,000** |

And that's just the *visible* cost.

The invisible cost? Every shortcut, every trick, every "I just know" — gone.

**Now flip it:**

What if you captured that knowledge *before* they left?

- New tech ramp time: Cut in half
- First-time fix rate: Up 30-40%
- Tribal knowledge: Preserved forever

The ROI isn't theoretical. It's math.

One prevented outage pays for FactoryLM for a year.

## Email 14: Quick Question Survey (Day 45)

**Subject:** Quick question about your plant  
**Alt:** 30 seconds — I need your input  
**Preview:** Shaping what we build next

---

Hey {$name|there},

I'm working on the next phase of FactoryLM and want your input.

**One question:**

What's your single biggest maintenance headache right now?

A) Finding root cause of recurring faults  
B) Training new technicians fast enough  
C) Capturing knowledge before people leave  
D) Predicting failures before they happen  
E) Something else (reply and tell me)

Just reply with a letter. Takes 5 seconds.

Your answer directly shapes what we prioritize.

Thanks,  
Mike

## Email 15: Join the Community (Day 49)

**Subject:** Join our maintenance leaders group  
**Alt:** Connect with people who get it  
**Preview:** 200+ maintenance pros, no vendors

---

Hey {$name|there},

Quick invite:

We started a private community for maintenance leaders using (or interested in) AI tools.

**What it is:**
- 200+ maintenance pros from manufacturing, processing, utilities
- Real conversations about what works (and what doesn't)
- Early access to new FactoryLM features
- No vendor spam

**What it isn't:**
- A sales channel
- A support forum
- Full of consultants pitching services

If you want in, just reply "I'm in" and I'll send the link.

No pressure. Just thought you might find value in the group.

**Preview:** Screenshots inside

---

Hey {$name|there},

We're putting final touches on the platform. Wanted to give you a sneak peek.

**The Dashboard:**

[Screenshot: Clean dashboard with fault queue, knowledge search, recent diagnostics]

What you're looking at:
- **Fault Queue** — Current issues across your plant
- **Knowledge Search** — Ask anything, get answers
- **Recent Diagnostics** — What your team just solved
- **Insights** — Patterns the AI is finding

**The Diagnosis Flow:**

[Screenshot: Fault code input → AI analysis → Suggested fixes]

Upload a fault. Get an answer. That simple.

**Knowledge Capture:**

[Screenshot: Tech adding notes to a completed diagnosis]

Every fix becomes future knowledge. Automatic.

This is what 2 years of work looks like.

Early access: 2 weeks.
