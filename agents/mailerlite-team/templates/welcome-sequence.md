## Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Subject:** You're in — Welcome to FactoryLM  
**Preview:** Here's what happens next...

Hey {$name|there},

You're in. Welcome to FactoryLM.

We're building AI that actually understands industrial equipment — not generic chatbots pretending to know your plant.

**Here's what you're getting early access to:**

• **Smart Diagnostics** — Upload a PLC fault, get step-by-step fixes in seconds  
• **Knowledge Capture** — Your best technician's expertise, available to everyone  
• **Predictive Alerts** — Know what's failing before it fails  

We're rolling out access over the next few weeks. You'll be among the first to try it.

In the meantime, I'll send you some insights on where industrial maintenance is headed — and why the old way isn't cutting it anymore.

Talk soon,  
**Mike Harper**  
Founder, FactoryLM

P.S. — Have a specific problem you're dealing with? Just reply to this email. I read every one.

## Email 2: Value Content (Day 3)

**Subject:** The $260K problem nobody talks about  
**Preview:** Why your best techs are your biggest risk

---

Hey {$name|there},

Here's a number that should scare you: **$260,000**.

That's the average cost when a senior maintenance tech retires — taking 30 years of tribal knowledge with them.

The new hire? They've got the degree, but they don't know that Motor 7 always trips on humid days. Or that the conveyor bearing sounds different before it fails.

**This is the problem we built FactoryLM to solve.**

Not by replacing your techs — by making sure their knowledge doesn't walk out the door.

Here's how it works:

1. **Capture** — Every diagnosis, every fix, every "I just know" moment gets logged
2. **Learn** — AI connects patterns humans miss
3. **Share** — New techs get answers from 30 years of experience on day one

We've seen plants cut training time by 60% and first-time fix rates jump by 40%.

Your early access is coming soon. I'll let you know the moment it's ready.

— Mike

## Email 3: Product Intro + CTA (Day 7)

**Subject:** Ready to see what I've been building?  
**Preview:** Your early access is almost here

---

Hey {$name|there},

For the last two years, I've been obsessed with one question:

*Why is industrial maintenance still stuck in the 1990s?*

Paper logs. Tribal knowledge. Techs driving 3 hours because nobody documented a fix.

**FactoryLM is my answer.**

It's an AI that actually speaks industrial — PLC faults, ladder logic, Modbus protocols. Not a generic chatbot with a hard hat emoji.

**Here's what you'll be able to do:**

✓ Upload a fault code, get a diagnosis in 60 seconds  
✓ Ask questions in plain English, get answers from your equipment data  
✓ Build a knowledge base that grows smarter with every repair  

I'm opening up early access next week.

**[Get Priority Access →]**

You signed up early, so you'll be first in line.

Talk soon,  
Mike

P.S. — No credit card, no commitment. Just early access to something I think you'll love.
