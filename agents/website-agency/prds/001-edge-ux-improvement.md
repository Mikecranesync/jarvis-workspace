# PRD-001: Edge Page UX Improvement

## Title
Make USB Configurator Card Interaction More Intuitive

## Problem Statement
The current card and USB port interaction on factorylm.com/edge is non-intuitive. Users don't immediately understand:
- That cards are draggable
- How to "plug in" cards to USB ports
- Visual feedback during interaction

## Proposed Solution
1. **Redesign product cards as USB thumb drives** — the iconic form factor everyone recognizes
2. Small, compact shape (like a real flash drive)
3. USB-A connector on one end that visually "plugs in" to the gateway
4. Gateway ports styled as USB-A female receptacles
5. Satisfying "click" animation when docking
6. Maybe a subtle LED indicator on each drive when connected

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Products look like actual USB thumb drives (compact form factor)
- [ ] Gateway has realistic USB-A port receptacles
- [ ] Plug-in interaction feels natural (drag thumb drive → insert into port)
- [ ] Visual "click" feedback when connected
- [ ] Each drive shows its product icon/emoji
- [ ] Works on mobile (touch-friendly)

## Priority
- [x] P1 - Important, do soon

## Assets Provided
- [x] Reference: Current implementation at /edge/
- [ ] Additional mockups TBD

## Notes
Mike's feedback: "card and play of the USBs is a little non-intuitive"
This is the first PRD for the Website Agency system.
