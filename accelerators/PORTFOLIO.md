## FactoryLM Pitch Summary

### One-Liner
> AI copilot that lives inside PLCs, turning maintenance technicians into experts with recursive learning.

### Problem
- 80% of factories run on outdated PLCs with no AI integration
- Maintenance knowledge walks out the door when veterans retire
- Augury/Uptake cost $500K+ and sit OUTSIDE the control system

### Solution
- **PLC-native AI** that reads/writes directly to industrial controllers
- **$30/device** vs $500K for competitors
- **Recursive learning** - every fix makes the system smarter

### Market
- $200B+ industrial automation market
- 50M+ PLCs worldwide with zero AI capability
- Targeting $1M ARR in 12 months

### Traction
- Working prototype on Allen-Bradley Micro820
- Production CMMS system built
- YouTube channel with industrial audience (Industrial Skills Hub)

### Team
- Mike Crane: 15+ years industrial automation, PLC programming, maintenance management
- Jarvis (AI): Full-stack development, infrastructure, 24/7 operations

### Ask
- $500K for: Edge hardware deployment, first 10 pilot customers, sales hire

## YC Application Draft

### Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less
`AI copilot inside PLCs for factory maintenance`

### What is your company going to make?
FactoryLM builds AI that lives inside industrial PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers). Unlike cloud-based solutions that monitor from the outside, we integrate directly with the control layer - reading sensor data, predicting failures, and guiding technicians through repairs in real-time. 

Every fix captured becomes training data. The system gets smarter with each interaction. We're building recursive machine learning for the factory floor.

### Why did you pick this idea?
I've spent 15 years as an industrial automation engineer, watching factories struggle with the same problems: veteran knowledge walking out the door, expensive consultants for simple fixes, and "AI" solutions that cost $500K and still can't touch the actual control systems.

The PLC is the brain of every factory. If you want AI to actually help, it needs to be IN the brain, not watching from outside. Nobody is building this because it requires deep industrial expertise AND modern AI knowledge. I have both.

### What's new about this?
Current industrial AI (Augury, Uptake, Samsara) sits outside the control system - they're sensor companies bolted onto existing infrastructure. They can tell you something is wrong, but can't fix it.

FactoryLM integrates at the PLC level. We can read the motor speed, see the fault code, correlate with historical fixes, and tell the technician exactly what to do - or in some cases, fix it automatically. That's only possible when you're inside the control layer.

### How do you know people need this?
I've been the guy called at 2 AM when the production line goes down. I've watched $50K/hour losses while waiting for a specialist who retired 3 years ago. I've seen technicians Google error codes because the knowledge base is a filing cabinet from 1997.

Every factory manager I talk to says the same thing: "I need to capture what my senior guys know before they leave."

### Revenue model
- **$30/month per device** for core monitoring and AI assistance
- **$100/month per device** for predictive maintenance and auto-remediation
- **Enterprise tier** for multi-site deployments with custom training

### How far along?
- Working prototype on Allen-Bradley Micro820 PLC
- Full Modbus integration for sensor data
- Production CMMS system with work order tracking
- Recursive training pipeline capturing technician feedback
- YouTube audience of industrial professionals (potential early adopters)

### Tech stack
- Edge: Python + Modbus TCP on Raspberry Pi
- PLC: Allen-Bradley Micro820 (expanding to Siemens, Omron)
- AI: Local LLMs (Ollama) + cloud fallback (Claude)
- Infrastructure: Multi-cloud (DigitalOcean + Hetzner + Oracle)
