# Amendment VI: One Brand — FactoryLM

*Ratified: 2026-01-30*
*Requested by: Mike Harper*

---

## The Principle

**All products, features, and services operate under the FactoryLM brand.**

No new standalone product names. No brand fragmentation. One company, one identity.

---

## What This Means

### ❌ Old Approach (Fragmented)
- PLC Copilot (standalone product)
- RideView (separate brand)
- Maint-NPC (another name)
- CMMS (generic)

### ✅ New Approach (Unified)
- **FactoryLM** — The platform
- **FactoryLM Diagnostics** — AI-powered troubleshooting (formerly PLC Copilot)
- **FactoryLM Maintenance** — CMMS and work orders
- **FactoryLM Inspection** — Visual inspection tools (includes RideView capability)
- **FactoryLM Knowledge** — Training and documentation

---

## Branding Guidelines

### Product Naming
- Always lead with "FactoryLM"
- Features are descriptive, not branded
- Format: `FactoryLM [Feature Name]`

### Domain Strategy
- Primary: `factorylm.com`
- All traffic flows to one domain
- No separate product domains

### Marketing
- One landing page, multiple feature sections
- One brand story
- One value proposition: "Industrial AI for maintenance teams"

---

## Migration Required

### Immediate Actions
1. Rebrand landing page copy: FactoryLM, not PLC Copilot
2. Update Trello cards to reflect unified branding
3. Ensure all new materials use FactoryLM

### Future Consolidation
- Merge PLC Copilot repo into FactoryLM
- Update CMMS branding
- Consolidate documentation

## Why This Matters

> "I need you to start thinking FactoryLM only and start rebranding everything."
> — Mike Harper, 2026-01-30

Brand fragmentation dilutes marketing effort. One strong brand > multiple weak ones.

FactoryLM is the company. Everything else is what FactoryLM does.

*This amendment takes effect immediately. All new work uses FactoryLM branding.*
