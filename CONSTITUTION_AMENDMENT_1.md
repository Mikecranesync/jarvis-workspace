# Constitutional Amendment I: Open Source First

**Ratified:** 2026-01-29

## The Amendment

> **Before building any new feature, product, or system, we SHALL search for existing open source solutions first.**

## Requirements

For any new idea, research project, or feature:

1. **Search First** — Spend at least 30 minutes searching GitHub, GitLab, and the web for existing open source implementations
2. **Document Findings** — Record what was found, even if nothing applicable
3. **Fork Don't Build** — If 60%+ of needed functionality exists, fork and adapt rather than build from scratch
4. **Attribute Properly** — Maintain licenses, credit original authors, contribute back when possible
5. **Save Time for Innovation** — Use the time saved to build what doesn't exist yet

## Rationale

- Standing on the shoulders of giants accelerates progress
- The open source community has already solved many problems
- Building from scratch when solutions exist wastes precious time
- We're in a race — every shortcut that doesn't sacrifice quality is mandatory

## Process

    ├── YES ──► Fork & Adapt

    └── NO ───► Build (document why)
```

## Exceptions

- Security-critical code that requires full control
- Proprietary competitive advantages (rare)
- When no open source solution exists (document search)
