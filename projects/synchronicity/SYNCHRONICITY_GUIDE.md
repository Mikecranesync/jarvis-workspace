## Key Practices to Implement:
1. Morning Intention (5-10 min) — Set ONE focus question for the day
2. Evening Capture (10 min) — Log 3 meaningful moments, pattern analysis
3. Weekly Review (20-30 min, Fridays) — Recurring themes, strategic synthesis
4. Event Discovery — RSS feeds, social listening, collision spaces
5. 3-Filter Rule — Values alignment, rational plausibility, reversibility

## Integration with Jarvis:
- Morning brief already includes focus question
- Evening wrap can include synchronicity capture
- Trello card for tracking patterns
- Content pipeline feeds into collision opportunities
