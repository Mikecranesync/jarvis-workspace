# FactoryLM Go-To-Market: AR Glasses First

## Positioning

**Not a CMMS. Not a chatbot. An AR platform for industrial intelligence.**

> "FactoryLM puts AI-powered diagnostics in your line of sight. Point. Ask. Fix."

## The Insight

Every industrial AR play is enterprise-first:
- RealWear: $1,200+ headset, enterprise sales cycle
- Microsoft HoloLens: $3,500+, requires IT integration
- Magic Leap: $3,299, developer-focused
- Google Glass Enterprise: Discontinued

**The gap:** SMB industrial companies (1-50 employees) have zero AR options.

FactoryLM fills this gap with:
- $349 hardware (Frame glasses)
- $99/month software
- No IT department required
- Works out of the box

## Target Customer

### Primary: Independent HVAC/Industrial Contractors
- 1-10 technicians
- $500K-$5M annual revenue
- Currently uses: paper, basic CMMS, phone calls
- Pain: Senior techs retiring, knowledge walking out the door
- Budget: Can spend $500-1000/month on tools

### Secondary: Small Manufacturing Plants
- 10-50 maintenance staff
- Own facility, own equipment
- Pain: Downtime costs $10K+/hour
- Budget: Will pay for anything that reduces downtime

### Tertiary: Training/Education
- Trade schools
- Corporate training departments
- Pain: Can't scale expert instruction
- Budget: Per-seat licensing

## Competitive Response

### If RealWear/Microsoft enter SMB:
- They can't match $349 price point
- Their sales cycles are 6+ months
- We'll have customer relationships locked

### If Brilliant Labs builds industrial app:
- Partner, don't compete
- Our value is domain expertise, not hardware
- Offer white-label option

### If big CMMS (Fiix, UpKeep) adds AR:
- They're software companies, not hardware
- Integration complexity is high
- We integrate WITH them, not against

- NPS score: >50
- Feature requests logged: 20+
- Video testimonials: 3+

### Phase 2 (Growth)
