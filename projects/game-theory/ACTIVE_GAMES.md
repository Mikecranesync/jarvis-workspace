# Active Games — Mike's Strategic Board

Last updated: 2026-01-27

## Game 1: FactoryLM Launch
- **Type:** Market entry / entrepreneurship
- **Players:** Mike (founder), potential customers (maintenance teams), competitors (existing inspection tools), employer (must not discover)
- **Mike's Goal:** Build revenue-generating products while employed full-time
- **Current Strategy:** Stealth build under anonymous brand, validate with real-world testing
- **Key Tension:** Testing at employer's facility while building competing capability
- **Optimal Play:** Move fast, stay anonymous until product-market fit confirmed, then have the option to go full-time or license
- **Next Decision Point:** First real (non-test) signup

## Game 2: Stardust Racers — The Work Game
- **Type:** Career leverage / underutilization arbitrage
- **Location:** Universal's Epic Universe theme park, Orlando FL
- **Ride:** Stardust Racers roller coaster
- **Role:** Electrician (3rd shift / nights)

### The Situation
- Mike is a highly qualified electrician hired for electrical work
- Actual job: nightly preventive maintenance inspections on Ride Vehicles (RVs)
- 9 trains total that run on the track
- Work is repetitive inspection — far below his skill level
- He's being underutilized — inspecting trains when he could be engineering solutions

### Players & Incentives
| Player | What They Want | Leverage |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Mike** | Income stability + time/freedom to build FactoryLM + not get fired | Deep technical skill, irreplaceable knowledge, building AI that could help or replace his own job |
| **Universal/Epic** | Reliable ride operations, safety compliance, minimize labor costs | Pay, benefits, access to equipment/real-world testing |
| **Mike's supervisors** | Shifts covered, no incidents, paperwork done | Control over scheduling, performance reviews |
| **Co-workers** | Same — stable job, minimal hassle | Social dynamics, potential allies or threats |
| **FactoryLM** | Real-world data, validated product, revenue | The tool Mike is building ON this job |

### Key Dynamics
1. **Underutilization = Opportunity**: They're paying Mike to do below his skill level. This means he has mental bandwidth and domain expertise to build FactoryLM using the exact problems he faces nightly.
2. **The inspection work IS the product**: Every train Mike inspects manually is a use case for FactoryLM's visual inspection AI. He's getting paid to generate training data.
3. **Stealth is critical**: If Universal discovers he's building automation tools using their ride data, it could be an IP/employment issue.
4. **The exit game**: Mike needs to stay long enough to validate FactoryLM but not so long that he's trapped.

### Strategic Analysis

**Mike's Dominant Strategy:** 
- Stay employed (income + insurance + testing ground)
- Do the job well enough to stay invisible (don't be the best, don't be the worst)
- Use every shift as R&D for FactoryLM
- Build the product that makes THIS job obsolete, then sell it to EVERY theme park
- Exit when FactoryLM revenue > salary

**Information Asymmetry (Mike's Edge):**
- Mike knows the actual inspection process intimately — no exec at Universal does
- Mike knows what could be automated — management doesn't
- Mike is building the tool — nobody at work knows
- Mike understands both the electrical AND the AI side — rare combo

**Risks to Monitor:**
- Phone usage during shift (filming/photos)
- Coworkers noticing unusual behavior
- Digital footprint connecting Mike to FactoryLM
- IP assignment clauses in employment contract (CHECK THIS)
- Burnout from working nights + building a company

### Optimal Plays
1. **Review employment contract** — specifically IP assignment, moonlighting clauses, non-compete
2. **Maintain cover** — be a solid, reliable, unremarkable employee
3. **Harvest data carefully** — test app on personal bolts/equipment, not Universal property (when possible)
4. **Build the network quietly** — connect with maintenance pros at OTHER parks/facilities
5. **Set a timeline** — X months to validate, Y signups to quit

### Information Needed
- [ ] Universal Epic Universe opening timeline / operational status
- [ ] Stardust Racers ride specs and public info
- [ ] Mike's employment contract details (IP clauses)
- [ ] Shift schedule / how much free time exists during shifts
- [ ] What exactly gets inspected on each RV (bolts, electrical, mechanical?)
- [ ] Who else is on the night crew / social dynamics

### Next Decision Point
When FactoryLM gets first paying customer — does Mike stay or go?
