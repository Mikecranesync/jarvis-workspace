# FactoryLM Go-to-Market Strategy

**Created:** 2026-01-29  
**Status:** DRAFT - Needs Mike's input

## The Problem We're Solving

Maintenance teams are drowning in:
- Paper work orders and clipboards
- Disconnected systems (CMMS, PLCs, manuals)
- No real-time visibility into equipment health
- Knowledge loss when experienced techs retire

**FactoryLM solves this** with AI-powered industrial maintenance.

- "Why most CMMS implementations fail"
- "I asked AI to debug my PLC fault code"
- "What if technicians had AR glasses?"
- "The real cost of unplanned downtime"

**Frequency:** 3x/week minimum
**Format:** Short insights, screenshots, videos

### 4. Cold Outreach (LinkedIn + Email)

**Target titles:**

**Message template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you manage maintenance at [Company].

We're building AI tools for industrial maintenance - 
things like an AI that reads PLC fault codes and 
smart glasses that show work orders hands-free.

Would you be open to a 15-min call to see if 
this could help your team?

No pitch, just want your feedback.

- Mike
```
