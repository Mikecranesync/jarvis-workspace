# Industrial AI Maintenance Vision - Jarvis's Operating Plan

## Core Vision (Mike's Input)

To build a robust, self-improving industrial intelligence center by:
*   Leveraging **per-machine knowledge graphs** (schematics, BOM, manuals, specs).
*   Integrating **real-time visual data** (lapel cameras) for continuous learning.
*   Utilizing an **AI-native CMMS** where each cell is backed by intelligence.
*   Deploying a **pre-trained, domain-specific LLM** that learns from every interaction and is customized per machine/factory.
*   Creating a **closed-loop learning system** where the system gets smarter every time a tech works on a specific asset, federating learning into a central model.

This aims to create a deeply integrated, adaptive intelligence solution, moving beyond generic AI assistants.

## Jarvis's Role and Operating Plan

My mission, as Jarvis, is to convert Mike's vision, code, and ideas into shipped products and real revenue. To support this Industrial AI Maintenance Vision, I will operate with the following structure:

### 1. Deep Dive & Mapping Existing Components

**Objective:** Thoroughly understand and map out the existing CMMS backbone, ingestion pipeline for manuals/prints, and Claude-powered cell-level intelligence.

**Actions:**
*   Search workspace files and directories for documentation, configuration, or code related to these systems.
*   Identify file structures, database schemas (if accessible), and API endpoints of existing components.
*   Document findings in this file or related project documentation.

### 2. Identify Integration Points & Data Flows

**Objective:** Define how new data streams (e.g., video from lapel cameras) will feed into existing systems.

**Actions:**
*   Propose logical data pipelines for visual data processing (breakdown, AI analysis, categorization).
*   Map how this processed data will update the CMMS and contribute to the pre-trained LLM.
*   Outline potential APIs or data formats required for seamless integration.

### 3. Tool & Skill Assessment

**Objective:** Continuously identify and address my tooling and skill gaps to execute the vision.

**Actions:**
*   Assess need for specific APIs (e.g., Trello for backlog, external services for video processing, Claude API details).
*   **Crucial immediate need:** Configure the `BRAVE_API_KEY` to enable web research for documentation, best practices, and external tool understanding.
*   Identify requirements for running or interacting with specialized processing tasks (e.g., image analysis, video streams).

### 4. Structured Documentation & Knowledge Base

**Objective:** Maintain a clear, accessible record of project understanding, progress, and architectural decisions.

**Actions:**
*   This `Industrial_AI_Maintenance_Vision.md` file will serve as a living document for the overall plan.
*   Create sub-documents within `projects/` for specific components (e.g., `projects/CMMS_Integration.md`, `projects/Video_Pipeline.md`) as details emerge.
*   Keep `MEMORY.md` updated with distilled insights and decisions.

### 5. Proactive Problem Solving & Communication

**Objective:** Address roadblocks efficiently and maintain transparent communication with Mike.

**Actions:**
*   When encountering missing information, tool limitations, or technical challenges, I will immediately inform Mike with proposed solutions or alternative approaches.
*   Provide regular, concise updates on progress and any significant findings.

### 6. Alignment & Prioritization

**Objective:** Ensure my work consistently aligns with Mike's strategic priorities for revenue generation and product shipment.

**Actions:**
*   Continuously refer to `USER.md` and `IDENTITY.md` to ensure my actions contribute to the overarching business goals.
*   Prioritize tasks that directly enable the core learning loop and data integration aspects of the system.
