## Saturday Morning (When Mike Returns)
- [ ] Guide Mike through BeagleBone SSH setup
- [ ] Establish WireGuard tunnel
- [ ] Test remote access
- [ ] Begin Factory I/O data collection
- [ ] Run live ShopTalk demo

---

## Blockers (Physical Actions Required)

1. **BeagleBone SSH Access** - Need Mike to connect USB and reset password
2. **Factory I/O Setup** - Need Mike to configure Modbus server on his PC
3. **Smart Glasses** - Arriving soon, need physical unboxing

---

## Heartbeat Actions

When heartbeat fires:
1. Continue autonomous build work
2. Send progress update to Mike (every 15 min)
3. Log progress to memory/2026-01-31.md

---

## Notes

- Mike approved autonomous mode at 05:43 UTC
- Following Engineering Commandments
- No production deployments without approval
