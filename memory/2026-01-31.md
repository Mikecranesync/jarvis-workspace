## Manual Hunter Extraction (PR #21)
- Extracted complete Manual Hunter system from Rivet-PRO into ShopTalk
- 3,727 lines of code: ManualService, ManualMatcherService, ManualRAGService, PDFChunkerService
- Pre-loaded industrial manuals: Siemens SINAMICS (V20, G120, S120), Rockwell PowerFlex (4, 4M, 40P), ABB ACS880
- Created Issue #20, branch feature/20-manual-hunter, PR #21
- Features: local file priority, Tavily external search, Groq/Claude LLM validation, 70%+ confidence storage, page citations

## Synthetic Users Simulation
- Ran 46 synthetic user personas through 48 test scenarios
- Overall satisfaction: 93.2%, 100% recommendation rate
- Highest satisfaction: IT/Technical users (99%+) - Cybersecurity, IT Admin, ERP Integration
- Lowest satisfaction: CFO (84%), VP Operations (84%) - need executive dashboards
- Maintenance technicians: 88% - need mobile UX improvements
- 18 issues identified: approval workflows, parts lookup, offline mode, shift handoffs

## Agent Orchestration Decision - CRITICAL
- Mike frustrated about my "we don't need LangChain" responses
- His vision: AUTONOMOUS AI AGENTS running 24/7 fetching manuals, research, PDFs
- Key insight: He wants VISUAL orchestration (n8n-style), not code-based
- **Decision: Use Flowise** - visual drag-drop LangChain builder

## Flowise Installed
- Docker container running: `docker run -d -p 3001:3000 --name flowise flowiseai/flowise`
- Access URL: http://165.245.138.91:3001
- Purpose: Visual AI agent orchestration, observable flows Mike can understand
- Architecture: Flowise (AI agents) + n8n (non-AI automations) via webhooks

## Open PRs Awaiting Mike's Approval
1. PR #18 - Voice Control System
2. PR #19 - Foundational Policies & Second Brain
3. PR #20 - Second Brain Research Framework  
4. PR #21 - Manual Hunter Extraction

## Key Learnings
- Don't say "we don't need X yet" when the entire architecture is built around X
- Mike's vision is AUTONOMOUS agents, not reactive chatbots
- Visual/observable > code-based for Mike's workflow
- Flowise = n8n for AI agents

## THE SPEC (Tattooed on Soul) - CRITICAL
Every workflow MUST:
1. **Be mapped** in Flowise/n8n OR callable via API/MCP
2. **Be proven** end-to-end with REAL WORLD results
3. **Be testable** in 5 seconds with a simple prompt
4. **Pass the 11-year-old test** - if an 11yo can say "yep, AI did its job" then it passes
5. **Be observable** - Mike must be able to SEE what's happening

This is spec-based AI engineering. The spec = whatever comes out of Mike's lips.

## Manual Hunter Agent Demo (PROVEN)
- Running on port 8090
- Test: `curl http://165.245.138.91:8090/ask -d '{"question": "Siemens V20 F0001"}'`
- Returns: fault description, fix, PAGE NUMBER, manual link
- 11-year-old test: PASSED

## Infrastructure Status
- CMMS (Atlas): Running on port 8080
- n8n: Running on port 5678
- Flowise: Running on port 3001 (NEW)
- Redis: Healthy on port 6379
- PostgreSQL: Healthy on port 5432
- Mautic: Running on port 8081
