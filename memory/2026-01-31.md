# 2026-01-31 — Edge World Model + Viral Launch

## P-1 PRIORITY: Tuesday Demo

Mike and I are building an edge AI industrial expert by Tuesday, with a viral "Build in Public" campaign.

---

## The Product Vision

**Elevator Pitch:**
> A pocket-sized industrial AI expert. Plug it into any factory network. WhatsApp it. Ask what's wrong in any language. It answers. No internet required.

**The Venezuela Story:**
> "Helping rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure with AI that works offline, speaks Spanish, and costs $50."

**Working Names:** ShopTalk, FactoryGenius, EdgeSage, MachineWhisperer

## World Model Explained

Mike asked for deep explanation. Key points:
1. World model = learned simulation of equipment behavior
2. Like AlphaGo learning Go by playing millions of games
3. Factory I/O is our training gym (simulation)
4. We teach it normal vs failure patterns
5. Sim-to-real transfer applies to real equipment
6. Physics-informed neural networks = faster learning

## Key Quotes

> "This is priority zero negative one. The highest priority there is." — Mike

> "If I mail this to a person in Venezuela... they plug it in, dial a phone number, and speak to it in Spanish... If this is not the miracle product of all centuries..." — Mike

> "Revolutionary ideas start out looking revolutionary. Venezuela needs this more than a dead man needs a coffin." — Mike
