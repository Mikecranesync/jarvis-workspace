## 16:06 UTC - Cloud Infrastructure Research

Mike wants to build a "supercomputer in the cloud" for under $100/month.

### Oracle Cloud Free Tier Issues:
- Signup often fails (credit card verification)
- "Out of capacity" in popular regions
- Some users report unexpected charges for "Always Free" resources

### Workarounds for Oracle:
- Fresh email not previously used
- Less popular regions: Phoenix, Sydney, Hyderabad, São Paulo
- Regular debit card (not prepaid/virtual)
- Sign up at odd hours

### Recommended $100/month Stack:
| Component | Provider | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Main VPS | DigitalOcean | $48 |
| GPU burst | Vast.ai | $30 |
| Oracle Free | Oracle | $0 |
| **Total** | | **~$78** |

### GPU Cloud Options Researched:
- **Vast.ai**: $0.15-0.30/hr (cheapest, community GPUs)
- **RunPod**: $0.44/hr (reliable, good UI)
- **Lambda Labs**: $0.60/hr (no egress fees)

Mike had Oracle signup issues previously - need to troubleshoot or pivot to Vast.ai.
