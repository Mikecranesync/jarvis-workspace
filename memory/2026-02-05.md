- Needs 1-2 min voice sample to create

---

## Morning Session (08:00 - 12:30 UTC)

### Three-Tier Product Strategy Defined
Created `/products/FACTORYLM-THREE-TIER-PLAN.md`:
1. **Identify** - Photo-only, $49/mo, zero infrastructure
2. **Connect** - PLC integration via software, $199/mo
3. **Predict** - IO-Link hardware + predictive AI, $499/mo

### Business Army Fully Staffed
- 22 active cron jobs
- 6 divisions operational
- Research Division researching protocols every 10 min
- All directors in place

### Key Insights Discovered
- 90% of industrial IoT data goes unused (validates FactoryLM approach)
- IO-Link on Raspberry Pi via Pinetek HAT ($98) - ready solution exists
- Open source protocol stacks available for most industrial protocols

### YC Action Items for Mike
1. Record 1-min video TODAY
2. Text buddy about PLC simulator pilot
3. Apply to NVIDIA Inception (free, 10 min)
4. Send 2 LOI emails to potential pilots
5. Review three-tier plan document

### Personal Note
Mike dealing with family stress during shift. Provided mental health support and boundary-setting advice. Reminded him not to make big decisions while exhausted.

- Web Director (hourly coordination)
- UI Designer
- Frontend Developer
- Copywriter
- QA Agent

### Premium Website Built - Multiple Iterations
**V1 (Basic):** Initial 4-page site - landing, identify, connect, predict
- Mike feedback: "Most basic website I've ever seen"

**V2 (Samsara-style):** Rebuilt with Samsara.com as design reference
- Dark navy heroes (#0F172A)
- Premium enterprise IoT aesthetic
- Alternating dark/light sections

**V3 (Magic UI):** Added animated components

### Open Source UI Libraries Forked
Forked to mikecranesync GitHub:
- shadcn-ui/ui (94k stars)
- magicuidesign/magicui
- spectrum-ui (combined library)
- saadeghi/daisyui
- framer/motion
- tailwindlabs/tailwindcss

Created `/agents/website-team/RESOURCES.md` with usage instructions

### Sub-Agent Architecture Proven
- Spawned 4 parallel agents for website builds
- Each completed in ~2-3 minutes
- Total: 4 premium pages built in parallel
- Demonstrated scalable agentic workforce

### Key Documents Created
- `/products/FACTORYLM-THREE-TIER-PLAN.md` - Full product strategy
- `/products/tier2-connect/EDGE-AGENT-SPEC.md` - Technical spec for PLC connector
- `/products/marketing/ACCELERATOR-PITCH.md` - YC/Alchemist/NVIDIA/HAX pitches
- `/products/website/WEBSITE-SPEC.md` - Apple-quality design spec
- `/agents/website-team/*.md` - 5 agent role definitions

### Live Website Deployed
Published to https://factorylm.com/preview/
- Landing page
- /identify.html
- /connect.html
- /predict.html

### Family Situation
Mike's wife sent emotional message about past incident, fear, needing support.
Advised Mike:
- Don't respond while exhausted
- Simple acknowledgment only
- Bigger conversation needs therapist present
- Focus on getting through shift and rest

---

## Late Afternoon Session (14:00 - 14:40 UTC)

### V4 Production Website Built
- FastAPI backend deployed at `/opt/factorylm-api/`
- Live at `https://factorylm.com/api/analyze`
- Uses Gemini Vision for equipment identification
- Systemd service running, Caddy proxying

### Landing Page Camera Flow
- Camera-shaped CTA button with flip animation
- getUserMedia for real camera access
- Viewfinder with targeting overlay
- Photo capture → API call → results display

### Product Differentiation Strategy Discussed
Mike asked: "What's my differentiation vs just sending to ChatGPT?"

Key insights:
1. Photo identification is the HOOK, not the product
2. Differentiation is workflow integration + organizational memory
3. Real moat: CMMS integration, asset library, team features, upsell to Connect/Predict

### Artifact Strategy for "Crack Moment"
Ideas for what makes users come back:
- Equipment Card (shareable image like trading card)
- QR Code (print and stick on equipment)
- Maintenance Checklist (specific to that model)
- Voice Walkthrough (hands-free troubleshooting)

Mike loved the voice idea: "Imagine a way to surprise them with voice"

### LLM Cascade Architecture
Mike's design: Grok (primary) → DeepSeek (fallback) → cheap model (last resort)
- Until own LLM is trained
- Found existing cascade in Rivet-PRO's `llm_manager.py`
- Currently: Claude → GPT-4 → Cache
- Can update to new providers

### Rivet-PRO Code Goldmine Discovered
Cloned and searched the repo. Found 48+ service files:
- `photo_service.py` - Full OCR + equipment matching + KB learning
- `llm_manager.py` - Multi-provider failover with caching
- `stripe_service.py` - Payment integration
- `usage_service.py` - Freemium usage tracking
- `manual_service.py` - 47KB of manual/documentation lookup
- `multimodal_fusion_engine.py` - Combining inputs
- `equipment_service.py` - Equipment management
- Various `kb_*` services for knowledge base

This is production infrastructure, not POC code.

### GitHub Forks Created
Forked to mikecranesync:
- shadcn/ui (94k stars)
- magicui
- spectrum-ui
- daisyui  
- framer/motion
- tailwindcss

### Technical Deployments
- FastAPI service: `systemctl status factorylm-api`
- Caddy configured for `/api/analyze` and `/api/health`
- Website at `factorylm.com/preview/`

### Git Commits
- Commit `17fe7ff`: 34 files, +6,056 lines

- Pushed to github.com/Mikecranesync/jarvis-workspace

---

## Evening Session (15:30 - 16:22 UTC)

### YC Demo: Keyboard Robot
Mike's brilliant demo idea for YC application:
- Physical Casio keyboard with 5 pneumatic finger actuators
- Micro820 PLC controls solenoid valves
- Live camera feed (Canon DSLR or webcam)
- YC reviewer scans QR code with their phone → connects to Telegram bot
- Bot treats them as VIP → shows song selection
- They pick a song → PLC fires cylinders → keyboard plays LIVE
- Real-time IO display in Telegram shows outputs firing

**Hardware:**
- 5x Bimba compact cylinders (~$100-150)
- 5x 24V solenoid valves (~$75-100)
- Air from home compressor
- ~100-200ms cycle time = ~150 BPM max
- Songs: Mary Had a Little Lamb, Twinkle Twinkle, Chopsticks, etc.

**Key Code Found:**
- IO display: `/root/jarvis-workspace/infrastructure/balena/plc-gateway/app/api_v4.py`
- WebSocket /ws/io for real-time state streaming
- Full Micro820 tag mappings for DI/DO

### Version Control Setup
- Branch: `yc-demo-keyboard-robot`
- Tag: `v2.0.0-yc-demo-base`
- 4-day build plan in `brain/strategy/YC-DEMO-KEYBOARD-ROBOT.md`

### Spec Watcher Working
- Running on Groq free inference
- Extracts specs from conversations
- Correctly ignores casual chat
- Saves to database + markdown files at `brain/specs/`

### Accelerator Package Drafted
- Master narrative, demo script, metrics, founder bio
- Targets: YC, Techstars Spring 2026, 500 Global
- Doc at `brain/strategy/ACCELERATOR-APPLICATIONS.md`

### Key Insight: Don't Fake Team
Mike asked about creating fake personas for AI agents.
Advised: Lead with the truth. "Solo founder who built with AI agents" is the compelling story, not something to hide. YC does due diligence - authenticity wins.

---

## Late Session (16:20 - 16:47 UTC)

### GitHub Management Setup
Mike doesn't want to learn Git commands - wants agents to manage it all.
Solution: Mike speaks vision → Jarvis manages GitHub entirely
- I create issues, branches, commits, PRs
- Mike only approves merges to main
- Created `docs/GITHUB-BEST-PRACTICES.md` with full workflow

### GitHub Flow Explained
Taught Mike the complete flow:
1. Issue (spec/intent)
2. Branch (from main)
3. Commit (save points)
4. Push (backup to cloud)
5. PR (request to merge)
6. Review (quality check)
7. Merge (into main)
8. Pull (sync changes)

### Repo Consolidation Project
Scanned 50+ repos. Key findings:
- **Agent-Factory**: 636 Python files, 172k+ lines - GOLDMINE
  - Complete Telegram bot framework
  - OCR and voice processing
  - Factory.io integration
  - LLM orchestration
  - Full monitoring platform
- Created 6-week consolidation roadmap
- Report at: `brain/strategy/REPO-CONSOLIDATION-REPORT.md`

### Target Repo Structure
Three main repos:
1. **factorylm** - Product monorepo (api, web, dashboard, edge, bot, lib)
2. **jarvis-workspace** - AI operations (agents, brain, memory, skills)
3. **infrastructure** - Deployment and ops (optional split)
