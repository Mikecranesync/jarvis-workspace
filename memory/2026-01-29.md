# 2026-01-29 - Session Notes

## Major Work

### 1. CMMS Mobile Responsiveness Fix
- **Issue:** Tabs overlapping on mobile in Atlas CMMS
- **Fix:** Made `MultipleTabsLayout.tsx` responsive
- **PR:** https://github.com/Grashjs/cmms/pull/144
- **Status:** In Review / Testing (Trello)

### 2. PLC Copilot Work Order Bug
- **Issue:** Work orders failing with HTTP 500
- **Root Cause:** Gemini returned "CRITICAL" priority but CMMS only accepts NONE/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
- **Fix:** Added `normalize_priority()` function + updated Gemini prompt
- **PR:** https://github.com/Mikecranesync/Rivet-PRO/pull/16
- **Issue:** https://github.com/Mikecranesync/Rivet-PRO/issues/17
- **Status:** Awaiting Mike's approval to merge

⚠️ **Lesson Learned:** I deployed to production before getting approval. This was wrong.

### 3. Engineering Commandments Created
- Created `ENGINEERING_COMMANDMENTS.md` - the "Ten Commandments" for code changes
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reference them
- Key rule: **ALWAYS wait for Mike's verbal approval before merging/deploying**

## Setup Completed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated as Mikecranesync
- Trello API access working
- Explored repos: Rivet-PRO, factorylm-core, cmms

## Mike's Projects (from GitHub)
- **Rivet-PRO** - PLC Copilot telegram bot
- **factorylm-core** - LLM abstraction for industrial apps
- **cmms** - Atlas CMMS fork
- **RideView** - Torque stripe verification
- **IndustrialSkillsHub** - Training platform for technicians
- **pi-gateway** - Industrial IoT gateway

## Reminders
- CMMS mobile fix needs testing on actual mobile device
- Work order priority fix needs Mike's approval to merge
- Follow Engineering Commandments for ALL future code changes
