## What Was Built Tonight

### 1. KB Enrichment Pipeline (234 tests)
- 6-phase pipeline: Trigger → Search → Download → Parse → Store → Metrics
- Auto-finds manuals when new equipment detected
- Google Custom Search + ManualsLib integration
- PDF parsing with spec extraction
- Wired into `equipment_matcher.py` - triggers on new equipment

### 2. Spanish Localization (25 tests)
- Full i18n framework with Translator, Detector, Middleware
- `translations/en.json` and `translations/es.json`
- Auto-detects language from LATAM phone prefixes
- Key for Venezuela/Mexico/Colombia market

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - runs on push/PR
- `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` - daily regression
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality

### 4. E2E Smoke Tests (81 tests)
- Quick sanity check for deployments
- Covers all major flows

### 5. WhatsApp/Twilio Integration (56 tests)
- `TwilioWhatsAppClient` - send/receive/media
- Webhook with signature verification
- **Shared MessageRouter** - Telegram + WhatsApp use same logic
- Spanish auto-detection from phone numbers
- Voice transcription (Whisper)

### 6. Landing Page (27 files)

## Technical Notes

- Sub-agents work great for parallel feature building
- Spec-driven development (write spec → spawn agent → tests first) is effective
- MessageRouter pattern allows easy multi-platform support
- Mike works third shift (nights) - active late EST

## Mike's Context
- Wife is Venezuelan → perfect for Spanish testing
- Has Factory I/O setup on second laptop
- Phone is Android (for RideView testing)
- Telegram chat ID: 8445149012
