## Session 2 - Factory I/O Integration

### Created GitHub Repo
- **factorylm-landing** pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/Mikecranesync/factorylm-landing

### Factory I/O Integration Built

Mike has Factory I/O installed at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Real Games\Factory IO`.

Created direct integration between FactoryLM and Factory I/O using Modbus TCP:

#### New Files Created:
```
projects/factorylm-plc-client/
├── src/factorylm_plc/factory_io_direct.py    # Direct Modbus connector
├── backend/routes/factory_io.py              # REST API for Factory I/O
├── docs/FACTORY_IO_SETUP.md                  # Setup guide
└── scripts/test_factory_io.py                # Test script
```

#### Key Features:
- **FactoryIODirect** class - connects directly to Factory I/O's Modbus TCP server
- Pre-configured tag mappings for common scenes:
  - Sorting by Height
  - From A to B
  - Filling Tank
  - Production Line
- Full REST API at `/api/factory-io/...`
- Test script for verification

#### How to Test:
1. Start Factory I/O → Load "Sorting by Height" → F4 select "Modbus TCP/IP Server" → F5 play
2. Run: `python scripts/test_factory_io.py`
3. Or start backend and use API

#### API Endpoints Added:
- `GET /api/factory-io/status` - connection status
- `POST /api/factory-io/connect` - connect to Factory I/O
- `POST /api/factory-io/disconnect` - disconnect
- `GET /api/factory-io/state` - read full simulation state
- `GET /api/factory-io/tags` - list configured tags
- `POST /api/factory-io/write/coil` - control digital outputs
- `GET/POST` various read/write endpoints
