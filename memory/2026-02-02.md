## FactoryLM Edge Session (22:00 - 00:00 UTC)

### Major Accomplishments:
1. ✅ VPS ↔ Laptop bidirectional control working (SSH + API)
2. ✅ Discovered Jarvis Node API at 100.72.2.99:8765
3. ✅ Toast notifications working across network
4. ✅ FactoryLM diagnosis service integrated
5. ✅ System broadcast to all nodes working

### In Progress:
- 🟡 Raspberry Pi Edge setup (Pi not booting/detected)
- 🟡 Device auto-announce system (designed, not deployed)

### Key Discovery:
- Port 8765 on laptops = Jarvis Node Agent
- Endpoints: /health, /shell, /notify, /screenshot, /system-info
- Much faster than SSH for remote control

### Files Created:
- `/root/jarvis-workspace/projects/FACTORYLM_EDGE_SESSION_TRACE.md`

### Demo Date: February 10, 2026
