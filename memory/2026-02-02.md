# 2026-02-02 - Day 4 Progress Log

## Autonomous Night Session (02:00 - 06:00 UTC)

Mike activated **full autonomous mode** at 05:13 UTC with instruction:
> "Enter autonomous mode and have the monkey crank the handle on the entire backlog and everything that needs to be built priority. Zero things first but continue through the night all the way till I wake up and there's no backlog"

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 🔥 RemoteMe MVP - Phase 1 Backend COMPLETE

**Location:** `/opt/remoteme/`

**Files Created:**
- `backend/main.py` - FastAPI application
- `backend/config.py` - Environment configuration
- `backend/models/database.py` - SQLAlchemy models (users, commands, nodes, usage_logs)
- `backend/routers/health.py` - Health check endpoints
- `backend/routers/telegram.py` - Telegram webhook handler
- `backend/routers/commands.py` - Command execution API
- `backend/routers/nodes.py` - Node management API
- `backend/services/command_parser.py` - Claude-powered NLP command parsing
- `backend/services/node_client.py` - Jarvis Node communication client
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `.env` - Configuration (Telegram, LangFuse, node IPs)
- `scripts/quick_command.py` - CLI tool for testing

**Service Status:**

- Integrated into `monkey_dispatcher.py`
- Mike will now get messages when tasks complete

---

### 🔧 Infrastructure Updates

**Jarvis Node Enhanced:**
- Added `/interpret` endpoint for Open Interpreter

- Updated both PLC and Travel laptop installers

**New Systemd Services:**
- `remoteme.service` - RemoteMe backend

**Nginx Sites:**

---

## Blockers (for Mike)

1. **Jarvis Node Installation** - Need Mike to run installer on PLC laptop
2. **Anthropic API Key** - Not configured (using pattern matching fallback)
3. **Domain Purchase** - `getremoteme.com` or `useremoteme.com` available

---

## Next Steps (when Mike wakes up)

1. Install Jarvis Node on laptop
2. Test `/laptop screenshot` command flow
3. Purchase domain for RemoteMe
4. Continue to Phase 2 (Agent Development)

## Context Clear Point (09:57 UTC)

### What's Running:
- Plane: http://factorylm.com/plane/ (12 containers)
- RemoteMe: port 8100
- Ground Truth: /opt/master_of_puppets/workers/ground_truth.py
- All services: healthy

### What's NOT Done:
- Jarvis Node not installed on Mike's laptop yet
- Plane account not created yet (Mike accessing now)
- Trello → Plane migration pending

### Next Steps:
1. Mike creates Plane account at http://factorylm.com/plane/
2. Get Plane API key
3. Wire Monkey to use Plane instead of Trello
4. Install Jarvis Node on PLC laptop (Simon Says style)

### Files Created Today:
- /opt/plane/ (Plane deployment)
- /opt/remoteme/ (RemoteMe backend)
- /opt/master_of_puppets/workers/ground_truth.py
- /root/jarvis-workspace/remoteme-landing/index.html

2. Verified bidirectional SSH works

Test result:
```
VPS -> Laptop: ssh hharp@100.83.251.23 
Result: SUCCESS (hostname: Miguelomaniac)
```

Foundation layer COMPLETE:
- [x] Tailscale mesh
- [x] VPS -> Laptop SSH
- [x] Open Interpreter (both sides)
- [x] Clawdbot running

Ready for coordinated builds.

## 12:47 UTC - SSH PERMISSIONS FIXED

Claude Code fixed the Windows OpenSSH permission issue:
- Changed from Full Control (F) to Read Only (R)
- BUILTIN\Administrators:(R)
- NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(R)
- Restarted sshd service

**SSH NOW WORKING RELIABLY**

Test: `ssh hharp@100.83.251.23` → SUCCESS

## 13:45 UTC - BIDIRECTIONAL CONTROL PROVEN

### Test Results
Claude Code (laptop) triggered VPS to remotely modify laptop file:
- **Command chain:** Laptop → VPS → SSH back to Laptop → PowerShell → File changed
- **File:** C:/Users/hharp/AppData/Roaming/obs-studio/basic/profiles/RemoteMe/basic.ini
- **Change:** FilePath from C:/RemoteMe/Recordings → C:/Users/hharp/Videos
- **Result:** SUCCESS ✅

### Current Connected Laptops
1. **Travel Laptop (miguelomaniac)** - 100.83.251.23 - ✅ WORKING
   - User: hharp
   - SSH: `ssh hharp@100.83.251.23`
2. **PLC Laptop** - PENDING CONNECTION

### Next Test
Mike wants to test Telegram → VPS → Laptop control flow.
He will send a test message via Telegram to see if Jarvis can execute a command on the laptop.

### Ready Commands for Laptop Control
```bash
# Read a file on laptop
ssh hharp@100.83.251.23 "type C:\path\to\file"

# Execute PowerShell on laptop
ssh hharp@100.83.251.23 "powershell -Command 'Your-Command-Here'"

# Run Python on laptop
ssh hharp@100.83.251.23 "python -c 'print(hello)'"
```
