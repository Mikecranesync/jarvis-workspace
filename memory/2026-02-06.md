# Memory Log - February 6, 2026

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. VFD + Motor Simulator Created
- `/opt/factorylm/simulation/vfd_simulator.py` - DURApulse GS10 emulation
- Modbus TCP server on port 5020
- Realistic motor physics (frequency, current, RPM, torque, temperature)
- For demo testing before real VFD arrives

### 2. Jarvis Node Industrial Edition Designed
- Full architecture for edge agent: `/root/jarvis-workspace/projects/jarvis-node-industrial/`
- Capabilities: Industrial protocols (Allen-Bradley, Siemens, Modbus, OPC-UA), edge AI, auto-discovery
- 24-week roadmap created

### 3. MkDocs Documentation Site Built
- Location: `/opt/factorylm/docs-site/`
- Deployed to GitHub Pages: `https://mikecranesync.github.io/factorylm/`
- Fixed 13 missing pages, all navigation working
- Professional docs like Stripe/Kubernetes

### 4. YC Sprint Dashboard
- Web page at `/opt/factorylm/docs/yc-sprint/index.html`
- Shows all 9 deliverables (90% complete)
- Deadline: February 9, 2026 @ 8:00 PM PT

### 5. Jarvis Hub WebSocket Server
- `/opt/jarvis-hub/jarvis_hub.py` - accepts node connections
- Running on VPS port 8765
- Travel laptop (MIGUELOMANIAC) connected successfully

### 6. Brother Bot Package Designed
- Full docs in `/root/jarvis-workspace/projects/factorylm-brother-beta/`
- BOT_FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SETUP_GUIDE.md, DEMO_SCRIPT.md
- For Mike's brother (maintenance tech in Indiana)

### 7. Autonomous PLC Server Branch
- Branch: `feature/autonomous-plc-server`
- Issue: https://github.com/Mikecranesync/factorylm/issues/22
- Goal: PLC laptop as autonomous Factory I/O simulation server
- Best approach: OPC-UA (not screen capture)

## Network Status
- VPS (factorylm-prod): 100.68.120.99 ✅
- Travel laptop (miguelomaniac): 100.83.251.23 ✅
- PLC laptop: 100.72.2.99 ✅
- Phone (pixel-9a): 100.73.197.64 ✅
- Pi (factorylm-edge-pi): 100.97.210.121 ❌ OFFLINE 2+ days

## Mike's Motors (from photos)
- None suitable for VFD demo (all single-phase or DC)
- Needs 3-phase motor (~$65 on Amazon)
- WorldWide Electric NT12-18-56CB is nice but single-phase

## Key Frustrations to Address
- Mike frustrated about GitHub organization/findability
- Need better branch/tag discipline
- Created proper branch + issue #22 as example

## Services Running on VPS
- Jarvis Hub: port 8765 (WebSocket for nodes)
- MkDocs: port 8000 (docs site)
- CMMS: containers exist but need config fix
- Flowise: port 3001
- Plane: port 8070

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. Get PLC laptop fully set up (Jarvis Node + Ollama + Factory I/O OPC-UA)
2. Fix CMMS configuration
3. Record YC video
4. Lab photos for video planning

## Evening Session - Robot Army YC Sprint

### Sub-Agents Deployed (9 total, 100% success)
**Wave 1:**
- yc-reviewer → REVIEW-NOTES.md (found pricing inconsistency, unsourced stats)
- video-improver → VIDEO-IMPROVEMENTS.md (weak opening, needs 3AM hook)
- traction-amplifier → TRACTION-ENHANCED.md (40x faster than industry)
- electrical-engineer → ELECTRICAL-DIAGRAMS.md (full conveyor wiring)
- interview-prep → INTERVIEW-PREP.md (20 YC questions with answers)

**Wave 2:**
- stat-sourcer → SOURCED-STATISTICS.md (downtime is $260K/hr not $50K!)
- pricing-fixer → Updated 6 files to $30/device/month
- script-rewriter → video-script-v2.md (3AM hook + prediction moment)
- competitor-intel → Updated competitor-analysis.md (MaintainX $2.5B)

### Trello Updated
Added 6 new cards to In Progress for YC sprint tasks.

### Key Discovery
Original "$50K/hour downtime" stat is actually $260K/hour per McKinsey - 5x STRONGER for our pitch!
