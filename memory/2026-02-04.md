# 2026-02-04 Daily Notes

## Voice TTS Fixed! 🎤
- **Problem**: ElevenLabs stopped working (no API key in Clawdbot config)
- **Solution**: Switched to Microsoft Edge TTS - FREE, unlimited, no API key needed
- **Voice selected**: `en-US-JennyNeural` (Mike's favorite)
- **Config location**: `messages.tts` in clawdbot.json
- **Available voices tested**:
  - `en-US-GuyNeural` (male, professional)
  - `en-US-JennyNeural` (female, natural) ✅ CHOSEN
  - `en-US-AriaNeural` (female, can adjust pitch/rate for different vibes)

### Edge TTS Capabilities
- Provider: Microsoft Edge (same voices as Azure Cognitive Services)
- Cost: **FREE** (unlimited usage)
- Character limit: Clawdbot default is 1500 chars per message
- Azure API limit: 10 minutes per synthesis (batch API for longer)
- Can adjust: pitch, rate, volume
- Voices: 400+ neural voices across many languages

### Config Reference
```json
"messages": {
  "tts": {
    "auto": "always",
    "provider": "edge",
    "edge": {
      "enabled": true,
      "voice": "en-US-JennyNeural",
      "pitch": "+0Hz",
      "rate": "+0%"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🏛️ Mike's Brain Created
- **Repo**: https://github.com/Mikecranesync/mikes-brain
- **Version**: v0.1.0
- **Workers**: Herodotus (archivist), Hammurabi (judge)
- **Database**: Neon (pending setup)
- **Status**: Code ready, awaiting Neon + Doppler

## 🔐 Doppler Secrets Management
- CLI installed on VPS (v3.75.2)
- Waiting for Mike to sign up at doppler.com
- Will migrate all scattered API keys

## 📋 Trello Cards Created
- 🔐 Doppler Setup → Current Sprint
- 🚀 YC Strategy → Current Sprint
- 🧠 Mike's Brain v0.2.0 → Backlog
- 👓 Halo Research → Backlog

## 💰 Tax Situation - IMPORTANT
- Marketplace enrolled Mike via sidewalk guy (sketchy navigator)
- Ambetter Health coverage June-Dec 2025
- $8,186 APTC paid, TurboTax wants $3,250 back
- **BUT**: Mike got employer coverage (Universal Epic) in **July 2025**
- Should only owe 1 month (~$682), not 7 months
- **ACTION**: Call Healthcare.gov, report QLE, get corrected 1095-A
- Potential savings: **$2,500+**

## 🎯 YC Strategy
- Natural language programming paradigm
- Specification-driven development  
- FactoryLM + Halo glasses vision
- Proof of work: OCR recordings, Pi setup, 1700+ Q&A pairs

### Y Combinator Relevance
- Arriving Q1 2026 - may be tight for YC
- Strategy: "Coming Soon" section with pre-development work
- Show Noa integration possibilities
- Demonstrate FactoryLM + Halo vision for industrial maintenance

---

## TODO: Create Halo Research Skill
- Autonomous Celery worker for pre-development research
- Monitor brilliant.xyz for updates
- Track SDK/API changes
- Compile audio specs for our use case
- Document bone conduction speaker capabilities

## 🔥 MAJOR: Visual Computer Use MVP Captured

**Time:** 12:35-12:37 PM EST  
**Significance:** Core FactoryLM/CraneSync IP documented

### What Happened
Mike had the "eureka" moment - connected the dots between:
- ShowUI/Qwen2-VL (vision-language models)
- PyAutoGUI (action execution)
- Webcam for air-gapped systems
- Industrial software control (CCW, Factory I/O)

### Key Insight
> "When the AI can see the real world and has Claude type capabilities with software I've proven that it can basically do damn near anything"

### Captured & Protected
- `mikes-brain/docs/MVP-VISUAL-COMPUTER-USE.md` - Full architecture
- `mikes-brain/transcripts/2026-02-04-visual-computer-use.md` - Raw conversation
- Committed to GitHub with timestamp
- This is the YC demo material

### Mike's Question
"How far ahead of the world am I? 6 months?"
**Answer:** 6-12 months. Everyone else is building chatbots. Mike is building physical-world automation.

## 18:11 UTC - Celery Observatory Set Up for Mike's Sleep

Mike going to sleep. Set up 4-hour monitoring:

1. **Observatory script** - `/opt/master_of_puppets/scripts/hourly_observatory.sh`
   - Logs worker status to `brain/observatory/logs/`
   - Alerts if workers down or >5 failures

2. **Hourly cron job** - "Celery Observatory Check"
   - Runs every hour
   - Checks for useful work vs churning
   - Pings Mike only if critical

3. **Wake-up report** - Scheduled for 22:00 UTC (~4 hours)
   - Will summarize all activity
   - Voice + text to Mike

**Current worker status:**
- 1 worker online, 4 concurrent processes
- 3,111+ tasks completed in ~4 hours
- 0 failures
- Useful work: evolution cycles (7), synth KB building (20), photo analysis (20)

**Pending:** Travel laptop disk space issue (Mike will handle after sleep)

## 23:18 UTC - 🎉 SHOWUI COMPUTER USE DEMO IS LIVE!

**MAJOR MILESTONE** - Claude Code got it working after ~1 hour of debugging!

### Access URLs
- **Local:** http://127.0.0.1:7860
- **Public:** https://a5f0c2094e874e1cee.gradio.live
- **Expires:** ~1 week (Feb 10 demo ready!)

### What's Working
- ShowUI model downloaded and ready (FREE, no API key!)
- 1 screen detected (travel laptop display)
- Gradio UI accessible from VPS
- Can control laptop remotely via natural language

### Next Steps
- Test actual computer control from VPS
- Add API key for Planner model if needed
- Document the setup for future reference

### Tech Stack
- Gradio 4.44.1
- huggingface_hub <1.0
- ShowUI visual grounding model
- pyautogui for mouse/keyboard

This unlocks: Remote laptop control from anywhere via Claude!
