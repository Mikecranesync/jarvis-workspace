# 2026-02-04 — FactoryLM Mini Strategy & Kickoff

## Session Summary (Feb 3 ~22:50 UTC → Feb 4 ~03:00 UTC)

Major strategy session with Mike. Pivotal night for FactoryLM direction.

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. FactoryLM Mini Architecture Defined
- **Three-tier architecture:**
  - Tier 1: ESP32 Sensor Nodes (~$30 each)
  - Tier 2: Edge Gateway (Pi + Coral, ~$175)
  - Tier 3: Plant Server (optional, ~$800)
- Air-gapped capable, no cloud required
- LLM-powered natural language interface

### 2. Hardware Strategy Crystallized
- **ESP32-S3 + W5500** = universal sensor node
- **Google Coral USB** = 4 TOPS AI acceleration for $60
- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** = 67 TOPS for $249 (AI-heavy apps)
- **LILYGO T-ETH-Lite** = recommended dev board (~$25)
- Full BOM with Amazon links created

### 3. GitHub Repo Created
- **URL:** https://github.com/Mikecranesync/factorylm-mini
- Initial firmware skeleton pushed
- PlatformIO project configured
- Modbus TCP + MQTT + network monitoring code

### 4. Field Logs Captured
- `brain/field-logs/2026-02-04-florida-natural-duplicate-cpu.md`
  - Real-world troubleshooting scenario
  - How $15 ESP32 nodes would have caught IP conflict in seconds
  - Knowledge base training data
- `brain/field-logs/2026-02-04-cranesync-overhead-crane-architecture.md`
  - CraneSync-specific implementation
  - Yaskawa VFD integration via Modbus TCP
  - Wireless architecture for crane-mounted nodes

### 5. Knowledge Base Documents
- `brain/FACTORYLM_MINI_MASTER.md` - Architecture overview
- `brain/FACTORYLM_MINI_HARDWARE_BOM.md` - Shopping list with Amazon links
- `brain/FACTORYLM_MINI_PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Day-by-day plan through Feb 10 demo
- `projects/FACTORYLM_SENSOR_NODE_SPECS.md` - Technical specs
- `projects/SIGNAL_DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md` - Signal channel strategy
- `projects/WHATSAPP_ADAPTER_STRATEGY.md` - WhatsApp integration plan

## Key Strategic Insights

### The Big Realization
> "Have I just discovered the way to put any machine online and have it be analyzed by AI for $30?"

**Yes.** ESP32 + FactoryLM = universal machine connectivity at 10-100x lower cost than enterprise alternatives.

### Competitive Moat
1. **Air-gapped** - No cloud dependency (defense, pharma, critical infra)
2. **Edge-first** - Competitors are cloud-first, 3-5 years behind
3. **Price** - $30/node vs $500+ competitors
4. **LLM Interface** - Natural language queries to factory

### Target Markets
- Small/medium manufacturers (underserved by Rockwell/Siemens)
- Security-conscious (defense, pharma)
- Air-gapped requirements
- International (Latin America, SE Asia)

### Safety & Ethics Discussion
- Read-only by default (no write to PLCs)
- One-way data flow
- Supplement human judgment, don't replace
- Liability considerations discussed
- IEC 62443 compliance path

## PLC Troubleshooting Session

Found Ethernet adapter issue on PLC laptop:
- Intel I219-V disconnecting repeatedly
- 9 NIC resets in one day
- Explains intermittent PLC communication

Created E-stop I/O visualization diagram for Mike.

## Extended Session (03:00 - 09:15 UTC)

### GitHub Repo Made Private
- Mike concerned about IP protection
- Switched factorylm-mini repo to private
- Can flip public later when ready for open source launch

### Email Integration Completed
- **Installed Himalaya** email CLI on VPS
- **Working accounts:**
  - harperhousebuyers@gmail.com ✅
  - hharperson2000@yahoo.com ✅

- Can now read, send, reply, forward emails
- Sent Venezuela Spanish templates to Mike via email
- Sent full FactoryLM Mini business proposal as markdown attachment

### Business Proposal Created
- `/tmp/FactoryLM_Mini_Proposal.md` - comprehensive business plan
- Includes: executive summary, architecture, use cases, competitive analysis, business model, go-to-market, roadmap, investment requirements

### Hardware Form Factor Discussion
- **Pre-certified modules** avoid full FCC certification (just need SDoC)
- **RevPi (Revolution Pi)** - Pi in industrial enclosure, EN 61131-2 certified
- **USB dongle form factor** possible - ESP-Dongle from Espressif
- **Goal:** Small enough for technicians to easily deploy

### Venezuela Freemium Strategy
- Give away $15 hardware to capture market
