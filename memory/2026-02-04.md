# 2026-02-04 Session Notes

## Gateway Crash & Recovery
- Gateway crashed at 11:26 UTC, recovered via auto-restart
- Mike received crash alert, confirmed resurrection worked
- Session backups now pushed to GitHub (`jarvis-workspace/backups/sessions/`)

## Website Agency System Created
- Built agentic website team for factorylm.com management
- Located at `/root/jarvis-workspace/agents/website-agency/`
- PRD-001 filed: USB configurator UX improvement
- Mike wants USB elements to look like **thumb drives** (compact form factor)

## FactoryLM PLC Client Found
- Discovered `mikecranesync/factorylm-plc-client` repo
- Complete Modbus TCP setup for Micro820 Allen-Bradley PLC
- Register map: 100-105 (motor_speed, current, temp, pressure, conveyor, error)
- Coils: 0-6 (motor_running, stopped, fault, conveyor, sensors, e-stop)
- Full SETUP.md with CCW configuration guide
- IP: 192.168.1.100, Port: 502

## Competitive Analysis: FactoryLM vs Augury
- Augury: $300M funding, sensor company, sits OUTSIDE control systems
- FactoryLM moat: PLC-level integration, recursive learning, $30/device cost
- Key insight: Augury won't pivot to Mike's architecture - they're locked into sensors
- Real competition is execution speed, not Augury

## Code Consolidation Plan Proposed
- "Digital twin" concept: Archive repos before consolidation
- Plan: Tag all repos → Create archive forks (read-only) → Consolidate into single FactoryLM monorepo
- Mike approved approach, wants everything versioned and protected
- Waiting for execution green light

## VPS Optimization Completed
- Added 4GB swap file (persisted to /etc/fstab)
- Cleared 185MB journal logs
- Stopped unused services: Mautic, Grafana, InfluxDB (~350MB RAM freed)
- Fixed cmms-backend crash loop
- **Key finding: VPS is on HDD, not SSD** (ROTA=1) - biggest bottleneck

## Infrastructure Expansion Plan Approved (~$105/mo)
Mike approved multi-cloud strategy:

| Component | Provider | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Oracle Cloud | Free tier (4 ARM, 24GB RAM) | $0 |
| Hetzner CCX23 | 4 dedicated vCPU, 16GB | $32/mo |
| DigitalOcean | Keep current (primary) | $48/mo |
| RunPod GPU | $25 cap, on-demand | $25/mo |
| Managed DBs | Neon/Supabase/Railway | Free tiers |

**Action items:**
1. Create GitHub issue for infra expansion
2. Set up Oracle Cloud free tier first (triple redundancy)
3. Scan repos for existing database credentials
4. Spin up Hetzner CCX23
5. Set up RunPod with $25 spending cap
6. Find & version-tag Ollama training code
7. Create PR with full documentation

## Mike's Setup Context
- PLC Laptop: Factory I/O + CCW + real Micro820 PLC
- Already training Ollama model on desktop
- Has accounts: Supabase, Railway, others (credentials in .env files)
- YouTube channel: Industrial Skills Hub (considering rename to FactoryLM)

## Recursive Machine Learning Discussion
- Mike asked about recursive ML - confirmed FactoryLM architecture implements it
- Flywheel: Human spec → AI solution → PLC validates → Lesson captured → System improves
- Academic terms: RLHF with industrial outcomes, continual learning, knowledge distillation

## Token/Prompting Advice Given
- Long prompts are fine, clarity > brevity
- Voice messages work great (more concise than typing)
- Images cost more tokens than text
- Mike's natural prompting style is effective
