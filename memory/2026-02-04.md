# 2026-02-04 Daily Notes

## Voice TTS Fixed! 🎤
- **Problem**: ElevenLabs stopped working (no API key in Clawdbot config)
- **Solution**: Switched to Microsoft Edge TTS - FREE, unlimited, no API key needed
- **Voice selected**: `en-US-JennyNeural` (Mike's favorite)
- **Config location**: `messages.tts` in clawdbot.json
- **Available voices tested**:
  - `en-US-GuyNeural` (male, professional)
  - `en-US-JennyNeural` (female, natural) ✅ CHOSEN
  - `en-US-AriaNeural` (female, can adjust pitch/rate for different vibes)

### Edge TTS Capabilities
- Provider: Microsoft Edge (same voices as Azure Cognitive Services)
- Cost: **FREE** (unlimited usage)
- Character limit: Clawdbot default is 1500 chars per message
- Azure API limit: 10 minutes per synthesis (batch API for longer)
- Can adjust: pitch, rate, volume
- Voices: 400+ neural voices across many languages

### Config Reference
```json
"messages": {
  "tts": {
    "auto": "always",
    "provider": "edge",
    "edge": {
      "enabled": true,
      "voice": "en-US-JennyNeural",
      "pitch": "+0Hz",
      "rate": "+0%"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🏛️ Mike's Brain Created
- **Repo**: https://github.com/Mikecranesync/mikes-brain
- **Version**: v0.1.0
- **Workers**: Herodotus (archivist), Hammurabi (judge)
- **Database**: Neon (pending setup)
- **Status**: Code ready, awaiting Neon + Doppler

## 🔐 Doppler Secrets Management
- CLI installed on VPS (v3.75.2)
- Waiting for Mike to sign up at doppler.com
- Will migrate all scattered API keys

## 📋 Trello Cards Created
- 🔐 Doppler Setup → Current Sprint
- 🚀 YC Strategy → Current Sprint
- 🧠 Mike's Brain v0.2.0 → Backlog
- 👓 Halo Research → Backlog

## 💰 Tax Situation - IMPORTANT
- Marketplace enrolled Mike via sidewalk guy (sketchy navigator)
- Ambetter Health coverage June-Dec 2025
- $8,186 APTC paid, TurboTax wants $3,250 back
- **BUT**: Mike got employer coverage (Universal Epic) in **July 2025**
- Should only owe 1 month (~$682), not 7 months
- **ACTION**: Call Healthcare.gov, report QLE, get corrected 1095-A
- Potential savings: **$2,500+**

## 🎯 YC Strategy
- Natural language programming paradigm
- Specification-driven development  
- FactoryLM + Halo glasses vision
- Proof of work: OCR recordings, Pi setup, 1700+ Q&A pairs

- Flutter SDK for iOS/Android
- Docs: https://brilliant.xyz/pages/developers

### Prescription Lenses
- Available through SmartBuyGlasses partner
- Display optic adjustable for corrective vision

### Y Combinator Relevance
- Arriving Q1 2026 - may be tight for YC
- Strategy: "Coming Soon" section with pre-development work
- Show Noa integration possibilities
- Demonstrate FactoryLM + Halo vision for industrial maintenance

## TODO: Create Halo Research Skill
- Autonomous Celery worker for pre-development research
- Monitor brilliant.xyz for updates
- Track SDK/API changes
- Compile audio specs for our use case
- Document bone conduction speaker capabilities
