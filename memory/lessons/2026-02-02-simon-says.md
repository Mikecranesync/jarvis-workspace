# Lesson: Simon Says Instructions

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Context:** Teaching Mike to install Jarvis Node on PLC laptop
**Teacher:** Mike

## The Problem

I gave instructions like:
- "Run PowerShell as Admin"
- "Paste this and press Enter"
- Multiple command options (SCP, SSH, download)

Mike rightfully said: "you need to tell me how to do this like a child"

## The Lesson

**Simon Says Rules:**

1. **Never assume technical knowledge**
   - "Run PowerShell as Admin" = meaningless
   - "Click Start button. Type powershell. Right-click on Windows PowerShell. Click Run as administrator." = clear

2. **One step at a time**
   - Give ONE instruction
   - Wait for confirmation
   - Then give next instruction

3. **Check where they are**
   - "What do you see on screen?"
   - Before giving next step, confirm current state

4. **Don't vomit options**
   - Pick ONE path
   - Don't offer alternatives unless asked
   - Decision fatigue is real

5. **Be explicit about EVERYTHING**
   - "Press Enter" not "run the command"
   - "Click inside the window" not "focus on terminal"
   - "Tell me when done" not assume they'll report back

## Applied

When guiding non-technical users through ANY technical process:
- Write instructions for a 10-year-old
- Number every step
- Wait for confirmation between steps
- Describe UI elements visually ("blue window", "bottom left corner")

This interaction is being recorded for training. The user experience IS the product.
