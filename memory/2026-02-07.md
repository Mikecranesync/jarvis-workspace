# 2026-02-07 Session Notes

## Major Accomplishments

### Hetzner Migration Complete ✅
- Migrated all 9 Docker services from DigitalOcean to Hetzner VPS
- Services running: atlas-cmms, atlas-frontend, n8n, mautic, mautic_db, redis, postgres, rustdesk-hbbs, rustdesk-hbbr
- Hetzner specs: 8GB RAM, 160GB SSD, €15/mo
- DO was at 90% disk, Hetzner at 10% — massive headroom now
- IP: 178.156.173.186 (Tailscale: 100.67.25.53)

### YC Core Thesis Developed 🎯
**Central insight discovered with Mike:**

> "You don't need more AI. You need less chaos."

**Layer Architecture:**
- Layer 0: Pure logic, poka-yoke validation, NO LLM (70% of requests, FREE)
- Layer 1: Local knowledge base, cached answers (20%, FREE)
- Layer 2: Local LLM / Ollama (8%, FREE)
- Layer 3: Cloud LLM / Claude (2%, PAID - last resort)

**Key concept: Poka-yoke CMMS**
- System won't accept garbage data
- LLM guardian for data entry
- "Makes bad data entry harder than good data entry"

**Moat:** Every cloud AI answer hardens into Layer 0 rules. System gets smarter by needing LESS intelligence.

**Quote Mike loved:** "LLMs are encyclopedias. Maintenance needs a diary."

### Documents Created
- `/docs/yc/PITCH-DECK-CORE.md` - Core thesis and pitch
- `/reports/yc-application-v2.md` - Full YC application rewritten
- `/docs/architecture/factorylm-user-flow-bw.d2` - Black/white architecture diagram
- D2 diagram tool installed for future diagrams

## Key Decisions

1. **File format rule:** Never send files people can't open. PNG/PDF > proprietary formats. Ask before sending unusual formats.

2. **Public demo bot concept:** Full Telegram bot for Mike's friends/brother - auto-provisions CMMS per user, poka-yoke data entry, invisible guardrails.

3. **RSS Intelligence Manager:** Concept approved - monitor open source dependencies, AI analysis layer, alert on breaking changes.

4. **LLM Training:** Mike wants to train small model on conversation history. Plan: RAG + custom persona first, then LoRA fine-tune.

## Issues

- **Pi offline 3+ days** - needs physical access to debug
- **PLC laptop offline** - Tailscale shows offline 2h
- **Travel laptop offline** - Tailscale shows offline

## YC Deadline
**Feb 9, 2026 11:59 PM EST** (~2.5 days remaining as of this session)

## Technical Notes
- D2 installed at `/usr/local/bin/d2` - diagram-as-code tool
- rsvg-convert installed for SVG→PNG/PDF conversion
- Chromium/Playwright downloaded for D2 PNG rendering (uses ~164MB)

## Mike's Brother
- Works at injection molding facility as maintenance tech
- Primary use case for demo bot
- Wants full experience, not limited demo

## YC Positioning Refined
Mike clarified: Still position as "copilot for maintenance" but differentiate with architecture.

**Final one-liner candidates:**
- "The maintenance copilot that rarely needs AI."
- "AI copilot for maintenance — where 98% of answers come from logic, not LLMs."

**Key differentiator table:**
| Other Copilots | FactoryLM |
|---------------|-----------|
| AI-first | Logic-first, AI-last |
| Every request hits LLM | 98% free (Layer 0-2) |
| Garbage in, garbage out | Poka-yoke prevents garbage |
| Stateless | Stateful (knows YOUR equipment) |
| Costs grow | Costs shrink (AI → rules) |

## Conveyor Demo Build
Mike cut materials yesterday per cut sheet:
- PVC: 2x 14" (rollers)
- Dowel: 2x 16" (shafts)
- 2x4: 2x 48" (rails) + 4x 14" (braces) + 4x 30" (legs)
- Threaded rod: 2x 18" (from 36")
- Plywood: 1x 12"x12" (motor mount)
- Belt: 6" x 120" rubber shelf liner

## Business Ideas Discovered Today

### 1. Jarvis Clean - Remote PC Optimization
**Time:** 14:48 UTC
**Trigger:** Cleaning duplicates from travel laptop remotely

**Core insight:** We can optimize PCs remotely via Tailscale+SSH without user interaction. This is unique - competitors all require local install and user action.

**Key features:**
- Zero-touch remote cleanup
- AI-driven safe deletion
- Automatic cloud backup
- Works over Tailscale

**Revenue model:** $9/mo per device or $29 one-time

**Status:** Proof of concept WORKING (freed 12GB on travel laptop)
