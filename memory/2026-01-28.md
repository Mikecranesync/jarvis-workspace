# Memory Log — January 28, 2026

## VPS Migration — In Progress (04:51-05:15 EST)

### Problem
- Mike closed laptop, Jarvis went offline — unacceptable
- Mike demands 24/7 uptime, "fireproof" solution

### Solution: Migrate Clawdbot to VPS
- VPS: srv1078052.hstgr.cloud / 72.60.175.144
- Clawdbot installed: v2026.1.24-3 (latest on npm)
- Config synced: /root/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json (full config with all env vars, Telegram, models, heartbeat)
- Workspace synced: /root/jarvis-workspace/ (MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, memory/, projects/)
- systemd service created: /etc/systemd/system/clawdbot.service (enabled, not yet started)
- **NOT YET STARTED** — waiting for Mike's go-ahead to flip the switch
- When started, laptop Clawdbot will get 409 Conflict and stop receiving Telegram messages
- Mike needs to run `clawdbot gateway stop` on laptop after

### VPS Disk Cleanup
- Was 48GB/48GB (100% full!)
- Cleaned: npm cache (1.5GB), journald logs (846MB), Docker images/volumes (~3GB), tmp (1.8GB)
- Now: 36GB/48GB (76%) — 12GB free

### Migration Checklist
- [x] Clawdbot installed on VPS
- [x] Config synced (all env vars, Telegram token, model config)
- [x] Workspace synced (memory, projects, docs)
- [x] systemd service created and enabled
- [ ] **START THE SERVICE** (waiting for Mike's approval)
- [ ] Stop laptop Clawdbot
- [ ] Pair laptop as a "node" for local browser/screen access
- [ ] Verify cron jobs work from VPS
- [ ] Set up workspace git sync (VPS <-> GitHub)

## Game Theory Engine Created (20:05-20:25 EST on Jan 27)

### Framework
- projects/game-theory/FRAMEWORK.md — analysis methodology
- projects/game-theory/ACTIVE_GAMES.md — ongoing game tracker
- Trello card: https://trello.com/c/sZtIFg11

### Game 2: Stardust Racers (Mike's Work Game)
- Mike works 3rd shift at Universal Epic Universe, Orlando FL
- Ride: Stardust Racers — Mack Rides dual launched coaster, opened May 22, 2025
- 2 tracks (Pulsar & Photon), 5,000 ft each, 62 mph, 9 trains total
- Role: Electrician, but actual work is PM inspections on Ride Vehicles (RVs)
- Key insight: **underutilized** — doing inspection work below his skill level
- Strategic advantage: every shift is paid R&D for FactoryLM
- Critical risk: IP assignment clauses in employment contract — MUST CHECK
- Dominant strategy: be reliable but invisible, harvest domain knowledge, build FactoryLM in stealth

### Information Needed from Mike
- Employment contract details (IP clauses, non-compete, moonlighting)
- What exactly gets inspected on each RV (bolts, electrical, mechanical?)
- Night crew dynamics — allies vs. threats
- Phone policy on the maintenance floor
- How much free time exists during shifts

## FactoryLM Landing Page Shipped (19:28-19:40 EST on Jan 27)
- Full SaaS landing: hero, features, how-it-works, pricing, signup form
- Signup API: FastAPI + SQLite + Telegram notifications
- First test signup registered successfully
- Contact: mike@cranesync.com
- "Building privately" status
- All committed + pushed to GitHub

## Key Reminders
- Mike's schedule: wakes 3 PM, sleeps 10 AM EST
- NEVER mention Universal Orlando in public content
- Anonymous identity: jarvis@factorylm.com (email not yet set up — need Zoho MX records)
- Namecheap login: hharperson2000 (DO NOT store password)
- factorylm.com is LIVE with SSL via Caddy

## VPS Clawdbot — Bot Token Conflict (05:05-05:11 EST)
- Mike provided a second Telegram bot token for VPS testing: `@photointel_bot`
- Token: 7926253676:AAHBUkpQoM04Itl7Uh_Ge1Au9LSg0Fp9ttk
- Updated VPS config (`botToken` field, removed stale `token`/`chatId` keys)
- systemd service started BUT hit persistent `getUpdates conflict` — something else is polling that token
- **VPS Clawdbot NOT YET LIVE** — Mike said he'll deal with the bot token later
- Stopped the service to prevent crash-looping

## Knowledge Base Expansion (05:24-05:30 EST)
- Mike said "what are we waiting on Christmas?" — just DO things, don't ask
- Ran massive KB expansion script on VPS
- **Before:** 36 fault codes, 134 articles
- **After:** 180 fault codes, 141 articles
- Manufacturers covered: Allen-Bradley (53), Siemens (33), ABB (29), Danfoss (26), Yaskawa (20), SEW-Eurodrive (17), Schneider (2)
- Added 7 deep-dive troubleshooting articles (PowerFlex overcurrent, SINAMICS commissioning, VFD ground fault universal guide, ControlLogix Ethernet/IP, S7-1500 PROFINET, VFD PM schedule, bearing failure analysis)
- Reddit harvester running hourly, pulling ~10 articles per cycle
- DB at /opt/plc-copilot/kb_harvester/kb_industrial.db (216 KB)

## CMMS Work Order Review (05:48-06:04 EST)
- Mike forwarded PLC-Copilot bot output showing a work order it created
- **WO #154 / WO000004**: "Install New Temperature Sensor with Display"
- Equipment: S+S REGELTECHNIK ATM2-I DISPLAY (Part #: 1101-1142-2009-900)
- 4-20mA output, 15-36VDC, IP65, adjustable temp range
- Priority: MEDIUM, Status: In Progress
- Created by: Michael Harper, Date: 2026-01-27 22:38
- Asset linked: #153 "Temp Sensor - Process/Location"
- **CMMS is Atlas CMMS** (open-source, Java Spring Boot backend on port 8080, React frontend)
- CMMS login issue: requires `type` field in JSON payload (tried "user"/"admin"), passwords tried: CraneSync2026!, Benjamin@2014, bo1ws2er12 — all returned "Invalid credentials"
- **Workaround**: accessed CMMS via browser tool (navigate + evaluate body HTML) — worked!
- CMMS has 44 total work orders, 10 per page

## Sensor Issue — Active Troubleshooting (06:04 EST)
- Mike installed the ATM2-I sensor, reading 0.9°C — says it doesn't work right
- Likely causes: scaling/configuration issue, wiring, or PLC input scaling mismatch
- Awaiting: expected temperature, actual mA output, process type
- Key spec: adjustable measurement range, 4-20mA output

## All VPS Services Running (as of 05:15 EST)
- caddy, factorylm-api, plc-copilot, plc-registration, rideview, trello-webhook, kb-harvester — ALL active
- clawdbot service: created + enabled but STOPPED (bot token conflict)

## CMMS Credentials (from Mike)
- Email: mike@cranesync.com (also: Mike@cranesync.com)
- Passwords tried: CraneSync2026!, Benjamin@2014, bo1ws2er12
- CMMS API requires `type` field in login JSON — values "user" and "admin" both returned 403
- **Browser-based access works** (already logged in session)

## CMMS WO Completed (16:02-16:06 EST)
- Marked WO000004 (ATM2-I temp sensor) as **Complete**
- Feedback: "Sensor installed and loop verified working. Photos to be attached."
- Mike said the loop worked OK, will attach photos later

## FactoryLM AR Pivot (16:15-16:25 EST)

### Decision
Mike is buying Brilliant Frame AR glasses ($349 × 2 = $698). FactoryLM is now AR-glasses-first platform.

### SDK Setup
- Cloned `frame-codebase` (firmware/hardware)
- Cloned `frame-sdk-python` (high-level Python SDK)
- Location: `projects/factorylm/frame-sdk/`

### Frame SDK Capabilities
- Camera: photos, autofocus, quality control
- Microphone: record audio, speech-to-text ready
- Display: text, graphics, 16-color palette (640×400)
- Motion: tap detection, movement tracking
- Files: read/write to device storage
- Lua: run scripts directly on device
- Bluetooth: connects to phone/computer as host

### Documents Created
1. `projects/factorylm/STRATEGY.md` — Full business strategy
2. `projects/factorylm/GO-TO-MARKET.md` — AR-first GTM plan
3. `projects/factorylm/frame-sdk/INTEGRATION.md` — Technical architecture

### Mock Prototype
- Created `projects/factorylm/prototype/frame_mock_bot.py`
- Telegram bot that simulates Frame workflow
- Photo → AI diagnosis, Voice → AI response
- Can test entire pipeline before glasses arrive

### Key GTM Insights
- Target: SMB HVAC/industrial contractors (1-10 techs)
- Gap: No AR solution under $1,000 for SMBs
- Pricing: $349 hardware + $99/mo software
- Expert network: $100/hr (36% margin)
- 90-day goal: 5 pilot customers

### Next Actions
- [ ] Mike ordering Frame glasses now
- [ ] Glasses arrive: Early March (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Build mock prototype (test AI pipeline via Telegram)
- [ ] Email Brilliant Labs re: distributor partnership
- [ ] Recruit first 5 Philippines experts
