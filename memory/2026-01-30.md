## Autonomous Mode Activated (17:20 UTC)

Mike asked me to work autonomously while he sleeps. I'm checking Trello every 5 minutes and doing tasks.

### Tasks Completed (Moved to Review):
1. ✅ LinkedIn Post #1: Why CMMS Implementations Fail
2. ✅ LinkedIn Post #2: AI Debugging PLC Fault Codes
3. ✅ LinkedIn Post #3: Smart Glasses for Maintenance
4. ✅ Podcast Research: 20 targets (4 tiers)
5. ✅ Podcast Pitch Templates: 5 variants
6. ✅ Cold Outreach Template v1: Email + LinkedIn
7. ✅ Blog: ROI of Predictive Maintenance (~1,100 words)

### Files Created:
- `artifacts/drafts/social-agent/linkedin-post-1-cmms-failures.md`
- `artifacts/drafts/social-agent/linkedin-post-2-ai-plc-debugging.md`
- `artifacts/drafts/social-agent/linkedin-post-3-smart-glasses.md`
- `artifacts/drafts/pr-agent/podcast-targets.md`
- `artifacts/drafts/pr-agent/podcast-pitch-template.md`
- `artifacts/drafts/outreach-agent/cold-outreach-template-v1.md`
- `artifacts/drafts/content-agent/blog-roi-predictive-maintenance.md`
- `artifacts/drafts/outreach-agent/prospect-list-framework.md`
- `brain/research/a2a-mcp-agent-coordination.md`

### Continued Working...
8. ✅ Prospect List Framework: 50 target companies
9. ✅ A2A/MCP Research: Agent coordination protocols

## Rivet-PRO Code Extraction Day

## Key Decision: One Brand = FactoryLM
Mike confirmed Constitution Amendment VI — everything consolidates under FactoryLM. Rivet-PRO, CMMS, PLC Copilot all become features of one monorepo.

## Rivet-PRO Deep Dive Complete
Discovered **502 Python files** with months of production-ready code:

### High-Priority Extractions (Ready Now)
1. **WhatsApp Adapter** (~40KB) — Complete Twilio integration with Venezuela +58 detection
2. **i18n System** (~20KB) — Full Spanish translations for industrial terms
3. **Message Router** (18KB) — Platform-agnostic multi-channel routing
4. **OCR/Photo Pipeline** (~70KB) — 3-stage analysis (Groq→DeepSeek→Claude)
5. **Equipment Taxonomy** (15KB) — 50+ manufacturers, pattern matching
6. **Claude Analyzer** (24KB) — AI troubleshooting synthesis

**Estimated value: 4-5 months of dev time already done.**

Full inventory: `brain/research/rivet-pro-code-inventory.md`

## FactoryLM Structure Review
Current Turborepo structure is GOOD:
- `apps/` — CMMS, portal, dashboard
- `services/` — api, assistant, plc-copilot
- `packages/` — config, auth, db, ui
- `adapters/` — channel adapters

**Recommendation:** Add `core/` directory for Python code from Rivet-PRO.

## 2026 AI Dev Best Practices Researched
Key findings:
1. Spec before code (Anthropic: 90% of Claude Code written by Claude Code)
2. Small iterative chunks (LLMs fail at monolithic requests)
3. Context packing (CLAUDE.md files with domain knowledge)
4. `.claude/skills/` directories for AI context
5. Turbo remote caching for faster CI

Full research: `brain/research/2026-ai-dev-best-practices.md`

## Next Steps (Awaiting Approval)
Mike said "go ahead" on extraction. Plan:
1. Create GitHub Issue for extraction
2. Create `core/` directory structure
3. Copy (not delete) Rivet-PRO code
4. Rebrand imports: `rivet_pro.` → `factorylm.core.`
5. Create PR following Engineering Commandments
6. Archive old repos AFTER extraction verified

## PRs to Close
- PR #12 (Slack adapter) — Rivet-PRO code is better
- PR #13 (WhatsApp adapter) — Rivet-PRO code is better

## Venezuela Campaign
Also created assets for Venezuela oil industry outreach:
- `brain/assets/factorylm-venezuela-one-pager.md`
- `brain/assets/venezuela-outreach-spanish.md`
- `brain/plans/venezuela-action-plan.md`
- `landing-page/venezuela/index.html`
