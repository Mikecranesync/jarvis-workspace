### Trello Updates
- Created Vision card: P0 BeagleBone Industrial Gateway
- Created 7 step cards for implementation phases
- Created Vision card: P0 24/7 Sales Automation Robot
- Created 6 step cards for sales automation

### Documentation
- Created CLAUDE.md for AI instance onboarding
- Updated brain/research/beaglebone-industrial-gateway.md
- Created brain/plans/automated-sales-robot.md
- Created brain/plans/48hr-sales-sprint.md

## Key Decisions
1. BeagleBone Gateway is Priority Zero (P0)
2. Sales Automation is also P0
3. All communication with Mike requires voice + text (Constitution Amendment V)
4. Build everything possible before requiring physical action

## Pending Actions

### Mike's Physical Actions Required:
1. **n8n:** Add Anthropic API key, link credentials, activate workflow
2. **Mautic:** Complete setup wizard (optional, can skip for lean approach)
3. **BeagleBone:** Flash Debian image, get on network

### Jarvis Next Steps:
