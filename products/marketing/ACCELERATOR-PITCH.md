# FactoryLM Accelerator Pitch Document

*One document, customized messaging for each accelerator*

---

## The Problem (Universal)

**US manufacturers lose $50 billion annually to unplanned downtime.**

- 600,000 unfilled maintenance technician positions
- Average technician age: 55 years old
- Institutional knowledge walks out the door every retirement
- 90% of industrial IoT data goes completely unused
- Existing solutions require 6-month integration projects

---

## The Solution (Universal)

**FactoryLM: AI copilot for maintenance technicians**

Take a photo of equipment → Get instant identification, troubleshooting steps, and parts info.

Connect to PLCs → See real-time equipment status with AI-powered insights.

Predict failures → Component-level monitoring with predictive maintenance.

---

## Why Now (Universal)

1. **AI Vision:** Models can finally read greasy nameplates accurately
2. **LLMs:** Can understand technical manuals and generate real troubleshooting
3. **Labor Crisis:** Plants can't hire enough experienced techs
4. **Edge Computing:** Raspberry Pi-class devices can run industrial protocols

---

## Founder-Market Fit (Universal)

**Mike Harpool spent 15 years as a maintenance technician.**

- Debugged PLCs at 2 AM with paper manuals
- Worked on cranes, roller coasters, manufacturing lines
- Self-taught programmer building the tool he wished he had
- Currently maintaining Universal's newest roller coaster while building this

*"I'm not a software person guessing what factories need. I lived it."*
