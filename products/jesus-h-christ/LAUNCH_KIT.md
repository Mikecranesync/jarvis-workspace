### Headline
**Your codebase is a graveyard of million-dollar ideas.**

### Body
That project you abandoned in 2021? It might be 80% of your next product.
Those repos from the dev who left? They contain patterns you keep rebuilding.

I scan your entire GitHub, find what's worth resurrecting, and give you a prioritized plan to ship it.

**What you get:**
- Complete audit of all repositories
- Hidden feature identification
- Commercial opportunity analysis
- Prioritized resurrection roadmap
- Code pattern extraction

**$99 for personal. $299 for startups. $999 for enterprise.**

## 🐦 Launch Tweet

```
I built an AI that resurrects dead repos.

Most companies have years of abandoned code. Hidden features. Forgotten products.

It scans everything, finds what's worth saving, and tells you how to ship it.

Offering audits: $99-999
