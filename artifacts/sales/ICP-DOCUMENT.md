**Team Size:** 3-5 maintenance technicians

**Budget Authority:** Can approve $500-2,000/month software spend without executive sign-off

---

## Pain Points

1. **Diagnostic delays** — Unfamiliar PLC errors take 1-4+ hours to diagnose
2. **Knowledge gaps** — Techs can't specialize in every PLC brand
3. **No reliability engineer** — No dedicated expert for complex troubleshooting
4. **Manual-based workflow** — Digging through 500-page PDFs for error codes
5. **Tribal knowledge risk** — Senior tech retiring takes expertise with them

---

## Buying Triggers

- Recent extended downtime from PLC issue
- Senior technician retirement announced
- New equipment installed (unfamiliar PLC brand)
- Failed audit or safety incident
- Mandate to reduce unplanned downtime

---

## Value Proposition

> "Photo any PLC error → Get diagnosis, fix steps, and parts needed in 60 seconds. No manuals. No phone calls. No waiting."

**Quantified Value:**
- Save 2-4 hours per diagnostic event
- At $150/hour fully-loaded labor + $500/hour downtime cost
- Each saved incident = $800-2,600 value
- $99/month pays for itself on first use
