## Email 1: Value First (Day 0)

**Subject:** The $1,000/hour mistake maintenance teams make

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for checking out FactoryLM.

Quick question: How long does your team typically spend diagnosing an unfamiliar PLC error code?

Most teams tell us 2-4 hours. At $500-1,000/hour in downtime costs, that's expensive troubleshooting.

The problem isn't your techs — it's that diagnostic knowledge is scattered across manuals, tribal knowledge, and Google searches.

That's why we built FactoryLM: Photo any error, get a diagnosis in 60 seconds.

Here's a quick guide to the 5 most common PLC faults we see:

P.S. — We offer 5 free diagnoses per month. No credit card required.

## Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3)

**Subject:** "That's $1,200 in downtime we didn't lose"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share a quick story.

Last week, a maintenance manager sent us a Siemens S7 fault his team had been stuck on for 3 hours.

FactoryLM diagnosed it in 90 seconds: voltage supply issue on a specific module.

His response: "That's $1,200 in downtime we didn't lose."

The tool doesn't replace your techs. It multiplies them — giving everyone on your team instant access to expert-level diagnostic knowledge.

If you're curious how it works, I put together a 2-minute video:

P.S. — What PLC brands does your team work with? I can share tips specific to your equipment.

## Email 3: Objection Handling (Day 7)

**Subject:** "We already have a CMMS"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I hear this a lot: "We already have MaintainX / Fiix / UpKeep."

Here's the thing: CMMS is for work orders. FactoryLM is for diagnostics.

Your CMMS tells you WHAT needs to be fixed. FactoryLM tells you HOW to fix it.

They're complementary, not competing.

Think of it this way:
- CMMS = Your maintenance filing cabinet
- FactoryLM = Your expert-on-call when you're stuck

Most teams use both. The CMMS logs the work order. FactoryLM helps the tech close it faster.

Does that make sense for your setup?

Mike

P.S. — We integrate with most major CMMS platforms. Happy to show you how.

## Email 4: Scarcity/Urgency (Day 10)

**Subject:** We're limiting free pilots this quarter

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick heads up: We're limiting the number of free pilot programs this quarter.

Here's why: Each pilot includes hands-on support from me personally. I want to make sure every pilot customer gets the attention they deserve.

We have [X] pilot spots remaining.

What you get:
- 30-day unlimited access for your team
- Direct support via text/email
- Custom training on your specific equipment
- No obligation to continue

If you've been thinking about trying FactoryLM, now's a good time.

Book a 15-minute call and I'll answer any questions:

P.S. — Even if you're not ready for a pilot, I'm happy to just chat about your maintenance challenges. No pressure.

## Email 5: Last Chance + Reframe (Day 14)

**Subject:** Last email from me (unless you want more)

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

This is my last email in this sequence.

I don't want to clutter your inbox if FactoryLM isn't a fit right now.

But before I go, let me leave you with one thought:

The best maintenance teams I've worked with have one thing in common: They're always looking for ways to get their techs home on time.

Every hour saved on diagnostics is an hour not spent away from family.

If that resonates, FactoryLM can help. We're here when you're ready.
