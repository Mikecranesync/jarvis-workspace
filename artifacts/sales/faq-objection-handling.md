## Top 20 Questions and Objections

### Product Questions

**1. "What PLC brands do you support?"**
```
All major brands: Siemens, Allen-Bradley (Rockwell), ABB, Schneider Electric, 
Mitsubishi, Omron, Beckhoff, and more. We're adding new brands weekly.

If you have a specific brand, send us a test photo and we'll show you 
what FactoryLM can do with it.
```

**2. "How accurate is the diagnosis?"**
```
We're seeing 80-85% accuracy on first diagnosis in our pilot testing. 
The AI gets smarter with every use.

When it's wrong, you can flag it and we prioritize fixing that gap. 
Think of it as training a really fast apprentice.
```

**3. "How fast is the response?"**
```
Under 90 seconds for most diagnoses, often under 60. 
That's compared to hours of manual research.
```

**4. "Do I need to install any software?"**
```
No. FactoryLM works through Telegram, a free messaging app. 
Download it on any phone, search for FactoryLM bot, and you're ready.

No IT approval needed. No complex setup.
```

**5. "Can it diagnose from text descriptions, not just photos?"**
```
Yes. You can type the error code directly: "Siemens F30001 fault" 
and get the diagnosis. Photos work best because they capture context 
we might miss in text.
```

**6. "What if I have proprietary equipment or custom error codes?"**
```
FactoryLM learns. If you have custom codes, we can add them to your 
knowledge base. Your team's diagnoses help train the AI on your 
specific equipment.
```

### Security & Data Questions

**7. "Is my data secure?"**
```
Yes. All communications are encrypted (TLS 1.3). Photos are processed 
for diagnosis and not stored long-term unless you want them in your 
knowledge base.

We never share proprietary data. SOC 2 compliance is in progress.
```

**8. "Do you see our proprietary equipment designs?"**
```
We only see what you send us — typically error screens and fault codes. 
We don't have access to your PLC programs, designs, or network.
```

**9. "Can you integrate with our existing systems?"**
```
Our Professional and Enterprise plans include API access. You can 
integrate FactoryLM diagnosis into your CMMS, mobile apps, or other tools.
```

### Pricing & Business Questions

**10. "Why $99/user? That seems expensive."**
```
Let's do the math: If FactoryLM saves one 2-hour diagnostic delay per 
month, at $500/hour downtime, that's $1,000 saved.

$99 to save $1,000 is a 10x return. And most teams see multiple saves 
per month.
```

**11. "We don't have budget for another tool."**
```
I understand budget is tight. Here's a thought:

What does one hour of unplanned downtime cost you? [$X]

If FactoryLM prevents one diagnostic delay per month, it pays for 
itself many times over. It's not a cost — it's savings you're leaving 
on the table.
```

**12. "Can we pay annually for a discount?"**
```
Yes. Annual payment gets you 2 months free — that's a 16% discount.
$990/year per user instead of $1,188.
```

**13. "Do you offer volume discounts?"**
```
For teams of 10+ users, we offer custom pricing. Typically:
• 10-24 users: $89/user
• 25-49 users: $79/user
• 50+ users: Custom quote

Let's talk about your team size.
```

**14. "What's the cancellation policy?"**
```
Cancel anytime, no questions asked. Monthly plans end at the next 
billing date. Annual plans are refundable pro-rata in the first 3 months.

We'd rather earn your business than lock you in.
```

### Comparison Questions

**15. "How is this different from ChatGPT?"**
```
ChatGPT is general-purpose. It's like asking a smart friend who 
might know something about PLCs.

FactoryLM is purpose-built for industrial diagnostics. It's trained 
specifically on PLC error codes, fault patterns, and troubleshooting 
procedures. The accuracy and relevance are much higher.

Try both with the same error code and see for yourself.
```

**16. "We already have a CMMS."**
```
Great — keep using it. FactoryLM isn't replacing your CMMS, it's 
adding a layer of diagnostic intelligence.

Your CMMS tracks work orders. FactoryLM helps your techs figure out 
what to put in those work orders.

Many customers use both.
```

**17. "How is this different from Googling the error code?"**
```
Three ways:

1. Speed: Google gives you 10 pages to sift through. FactoryLM gives 
   you one answer in 60 seconds.

2. Context: Google doesn't know your equipment or history. FactoryLM 
   can learn your specific setup.

3. Reliability: Google results are hit or miss. FactoryLM is trained 
   on verified troubleshooting procedures.

That said, Google is free. FactoryLM is $99/month. You're paying for 
speed and reliability.
```

### Skepticism / Trust Questions

**18. "This sounds too good to be true."**
```
I get it. Here's what I'd suggest:

Try the free tier — 5 diagnoses per month, no credit card required.
Send us your most annoying error code and see what comes back.

If it's not useful, you've lost nothing.
```

**19. "AI is overhyped. It won't work in the real world."**
```
Fair concern. A lot of AI tools are hype.

Here's why FactoryLM is different: I spent 20 years in industrial 
maintenance before building this. I know what actually works on 
the shop floor.

We're not trying to replace technicians. We're giving them a tool 
that cuts through the noise faster.

The best validation: Try it on a real error and see for yourself.
```

**20. "What if you go out of business?"**
```
Valid question for any startup. Here's our situation:

We're focused, lean, and building for the long term. We're not 
burning cash on office space or excessive headcount.

That said, if you want extra assurance, our Enterprise plan includes 
data export capabilities so you can keep your knowledge base no 
matter what.

## Objection Handling Framework

### LAER Method
1. **Listen** — Let them finish, don't interrupt
2. **Acknowledge** — "I understand that concern..."
3. **Explore** — "Can you tell me more about...?"
4. **Respond** — Address the specific concern

### Example
**Objection:** "We tried AI tools before and they didn't work."

**Response:**
```
[Listen] — Let them explain what happened

[Acknowledge] — "I've heard that from others. A lot of AI tools 
overpromise and underdeliver."

[Explore] — "What did you try? What went wrong?"

[Respond] — "FactoryLM is different because [specific reason based 
on their experience]. But I don't expect you to take my word for it. 
Try the free tier on your actual errors and see for yourself."
```
