## Connection Request Templates

### Template A: Curiosity Hook
```
Hi [First Name], I noticed you manage maintenance at [Company]. I'm building AI tools for industrial maintenance teams and would love to get your perspective on the biggest diagnostic challenges you face. Mind if we connect?
```

### Template B: Specific Pain Point
```
Hi [First Name], saw your role at [Company]. Quick question: when your team hits an unfamiliar PLC fault code, how long does diagnosis typically take? I'm researching this problem. Would love to connect.
```

### Template C: Mutual Interest
```
Hi [First Name], fellow [industry] maintenance professional here. I'm building something to help teams diagnose equipment issues faster — would value your input. Let's connect?

## Follow-Up DM Sequence

### Day 1 (After Connection Accepted)
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]! 

Quick question: what's your team's go-to resource when you hit a PLC error code you don't recognize? 

(Not selling anything — just researching how maintenance teams handle diagnostics.)
```

### Day 3-4 (If No Reply)
```
[First Name] — following up on my earlier question. 

I've been talking to maintenance managers and hearing that unfamiliar fault codes can take 2-4 hours to diagnose. Does that match your experience?
```

### Day 7 (Value Share)
```
Hey [First Name], thought you might find this interesting:

I've been building an AI that diagnoses PLC errors from photos. Early testers are getting answers in under 90 seconds instead of hours.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? No obligation — just want feedback from people who actually do this work.

Industrial Maintenance AI | 20 Years in Cranes & PLCs | Helping Teams Diagnose Faster | Founder @ FactoryLM
```

### About Section
```
I've spent 20 years in industrial maintenance — mostly cranes and heavy equipment. I've seen firsthand how much time gets wasted diagnosing unfamiliar fault codes.

Now I'm building FactoryLM: AI-powered diagnostics that help maintenance teams get answers in seconds, not hours.

If you're a maintenance manager dealing with:
→ Technicians stuck on unfamiliar PLCs
→ Hours lost to diagnostic delays
→ Tribal knowledge walking out the door

...I'd love to chat. DM me or book a demo at [link].
