# FactoryLM — Competitor Battlecard

*Use: Sales conversations when competitors come up*

---

## Quick Reference

| vs. Competitor | Our Advantage | Their Weakness |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **MaintainX** | PLC-specific AI, mobile-first | Generic CMMS, no real-time diagnostics |
| **Fiix** | Vendor-neutral, faster setup | Rockwell-biased, enterprise sales cycle |
| **UpKeep** | AI diagnostics included | No AI troubleshooting, just work orders |
| **Limble** | Instant diagnosis via photo | No diagnostic intelligence |
| **Spreadsheets** | Searchable knowledge base | Data silos, no learning |

## vs. MaintainX ($2.5B valuation, market leader)

### What They Say
"AI-powered CMMS for frontline teams"

### The Reality
- Work order management, not diagnostics
- No photo-based troubleshooting
- Generic AI (chatbot), not PLC-specific
- Enterprise pricing, complex setup

### Our Advantage
```
"MaintainX is great for work orders. But when your tech is standing in front 
of an unfamiliar fault code, MaintainX won't diagnose it for them.

FactoryLM is specifically built for that moment — photo the error, get the 
fix in 60 seconds. It's a different tool for a different problem."
```

### When They Come Up
- "Do you use MaintainX for work orders? Great — keep using it. FactoryLM 
  complements it by handling the diagnostic side."
- "What happens in MaintainX when a tech doesn't know how to fix something?"

---

## vs. Fiix (Owned by Rockwell Automation)

### What They Say
"Cloud CMMS with Asset Risk Predictor"

### The Reality
- Acquired by Rockwell — bias toward their ecosystem
- Enterprise sales cycle (months, not weeks)
- Predictive maintenance requires sensors and setup
- No instant diagnostics

### Our Advantage
```
"Fiix is designed for large enterprises running Rockwell equipment. 
If you're running Siemens, ABB, or mixed equipment, you're not their priority.

FactoryLM works with every PLC brand equally. And you can start today, 
not after a 6-month implementation."
```

### When They Come Up
- "Are most of your PLCs Allen-Bradley, or do you have a mix?"
- "How long did Fiix implementation take?"

---

## vs. UpKeep

### What They Say
"Mobile-first maintenance management"

### The Reality
- Good mobile app, but no diagnostic AI
- Focuses on work orders and asset tracking
- No troubleshooting assistance

### Our Advantage
```
"UpKeep helps you track work orders. FactoryLM helps you figure out 
what to put in that work order.

When a tech is stuck on an error code, UpKeep doesn't help. 
FactoryLM does."
```

### When They Come Up
- "Does UpKeep tell your techs how to fix problems, or just track that 
  they need to be fixed?"

---

## vs. Limble

### What They Say
"The CMMS that people actually use"

### The Reality
- Easy to use — but limited functionality
- No AI diagnostics
- Basic CMMS features

### Our Advantage
```
"Limble is simple, which is great for adoption. But when it comes to 
actual troubleshooting help, it's not there.

FactoryLM adds the diagnostic intelligence that Limble is missing."
```

---

## vs. "We Use Spreadsheets / Paper"

### What They Say
"Excel works fine for us"

### The Reality
- No searchability across historical issues
- Knowledge lives in people's heads
- When someone leaves, knowledge goes with them
- Repeated mistakes

### Our Advantage
```
"Spreadsheets track what happened. FactoryLM helps you figure out 
what to do next.

Plus, every diagnosis builds your searchable knowledge base. 
When your senior tech retires, their expertise stays."
```

### When They Come Up
- "What happens when your best tech calls in sick and there's a 
  problem only he knows how to fix?"

---

## vs. "We Call the Vendor"

### What They Say
"When we're stuck, we call Siemens/Rockwell support"

### The Reality
- Hold times: 30 min - 2 hours
- Not always available nights/weekends
- Expensive service contracts
- They don't know your specific setup

### Our Advantage
```
"Vendor support is great for complex problems. But waiting an hour 
on hold for a common fault code?

FactoryLM handles the routine diagnostics instantly, so you only 
call the vendor for the truly unusual stuff."
```

---

## Objection Handling

### "We already have a CMMS"
```
"Perfect — keep using it. FactoryLM isn't replacing your CMMS, it's 
adding diagnostic intelligence on top. Think of it as the brain that 
helps your techs figure out what to put in those work orders."
```

### "AI can't replace experience"
```
"Agreed — and we're not trying to. FactoryLM gives your experienced 
techs superhuman memory, and it helps newer techs perform at a 
higher level faster. The AI learns from every diagnosis, including 
the ones your team corrects."
```

### "We don't have budget for another tool"
```
"What does one hour of downtime cost you? [$X]

If FactoryLM saves you one diagnostic delay per month, it pays for 
itself many times over. Our pricing is $99/user/month — most teams 
see ROI in the first week."
```

### "We tried AI before and it didn't work"
```
"What did you try? [Listen]

Most AI tools for maintenance are generic — trained on general data, 
not industrial equipment. FactoryLM is built specifically for PLCs 
and industrial diagnostics, trained on 20 years of real troubleshooting 
data. That's why accuracy is 80-85% out of the box."
```

## Competitive Positioning Summary

**We are:** AI-powered diagnostic assistant for maintenance technicians

**We are NOT:** CMMS, work order system, or asset management

**Our moat:** 
1. PLC-specific AI (not generic)
2. Photo-based instant diagnosis
3. 20 years of domain expertise baked in
4. Mobile-first (Telegram = no IT approval)

**Our weakness (honest):**
- No work order management (yet)
- Smaller company than MaintainX/Fiix
- Newer product, less track record

**How we win:**
- Speed: 60 seconds vs. hours
- Simplicity: Photo → Answer
- Focus: Built for this exact problem
