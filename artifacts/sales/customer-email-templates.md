Hi [Name],

You've been using FactoryLM for 2 months now. Wanted to check in:

1. Are you seeing the time savings we discussed?
2. Any diagnoses that have been particularly valuable?
3. Feedback from your techs?

Also: Would you be open to being featured in a case study? We'd highlight 
how [Company] reduced diagnostic time with AI. I'd write it — just need 
your approval and a quote.

Let me know,
Mike
```

### Testimonial Request
**Subject:** Quick favor?

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for being a FactoryLM customer. Your feedback has been invaluable.

Would you be willing to provide a short testimonial for our website?

Just 2-3 sentences:
"Before FactoryLM, [problem]. Now, [benefit]. It's saved us [result]."

If you're comfortable, I'd include your name and company. Anonymous works too.

Either way, thanks for being an early believer.

## Churn Prevention Emails

### Usage Drop Alert
**Subject:** Everything okay?

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed your team's FactoryLM usage dropped significantly this month.

Just wanted to check in:
• Is everything okay?
• Any issues with the product?
• Has your situation changed?

If FactoryLM isn't meeting your needs, I'd rather hear about it than 
have you frustrated.

Happy to jump on a quick call.

Mike
```

### Pre-Churn Save
**Subject:** Before you go...

```
Hi [Name],

I saw your cancellation request come through. Before we process it:

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to share what didn't work?

Your feedback helps us improve, and I might be able to address whatever 
caused you to leave.

Either way, thanks for giving FactoryLM a try. Door's always open if 
things change.

Mike

## Upsell Emails

### Add More Users
**Subject:** Room for more techs on FactoryLM?

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed your [X] users have been active on FactoryLM. Great to see!

Quick thought: Would it make sense to add the rest of your maintenance 
team?

Current: [X] users at $99/month = $[Y]
Full team: [Z] users at $99/month = $[W]

If you add [N] more users this month, I'll throw in an extra month free 
as a thank-you for being an early customer.

Let me know if you want to discuss.

Mike
