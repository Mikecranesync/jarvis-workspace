## TESTIMONIAL (Placeholder)

> "We had a Siemens S7-1200 fault that would've taken us 3-4 hours to diagnose. PLC Copilot identified the voltage supply issue in 90 seconds. That's $1,200 in downtime we didn't lose."

## FAQ

### Does it work with my PLC brand?
Yes! PLC Copilot supports Siemens, Allen-Bradley (Rockwell), ABB, Schneider Electric, Mitsubishi, Omron, and 15+ other brands. If your brand isn't listed, contact us — we're adding new PLCs every week.

### How accurate is the AI?
Our pilot customers report 80-85% accuracy on first diagnosis. The AI learns from every interaction, so accuracy improves over time. If a diagnosis doesn't match, report it and we'll prioritize that gap.

### Is my equipment data secure?
Absolutely. Photos are encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and diagnoses are stored anonymously. We never share proprietary data. SOC 2 Type II compliance is in progress.

### Do I need to install software?
No installation required. PLC Copilot works via Telegram — just download the free app and message our bot. No IT approval needed.

### What if it gives the wrong diagnosis?
We learn from every error. Report incorrect diagnoses through the app, and we'll refund that diagnosis credit. On Professional plans, we'll also prioritize fixing that gap in our knowledge base.
