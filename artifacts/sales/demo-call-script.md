*Task: [V-PLC-7] Complete 15-20 Demo Calls*
*Duration: 15 minutes*

---

## Before the Call (2 min prep)

- [ ] Review prospect's company website
- [ ] Check their LinkedIn for recent activity
- [ ] Note their equipment types if known
- [ ] Have FactoryLM Telegram bot ready
- [ ] Have sample PLC error photos ready

---

## Opening (1 min)

```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in, I'd love to understand your situation better so I can show you the most relevant parts of FactoryLM. Sound good?"
```

---

## Discovery (4 min)

### Question 1: Current Process
```
"Walk me through what happens when one of your technicians hits a PLC fault code they don't recognize. What's the typical process?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Time spent (target: 1-4 hours)
- Resources used (manuals, Google, phone calls)
- Frustration level

### Question 2: Frequency
```
"How often does that happen? Weekly? Monthly?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Frequency indicates pain level
- More often = higher value

### Question 3: Cost
```
"Roughly, what does an hour of unplanned downtime cost your operation?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Direct cost (lost production)
- Indirect cost (overtime, expedited parts)
- Target: $200-1000+/hour

### Question 4: Current Tools
```
"Any software or tools you've tried for diagnostics? What worked or didn't?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Competitor awareness
- Past failures (know what to avoid)

---

## Transition to Demo (30 sec)

```
"Got it. So you're dealing with [summarize their pain]. Let me show you how FactoryLM solves exactly that. Takes about 3 minutes."
```

---

## Live Demo (4 min)

### Step 1: Show the Telegram Bot
```
"FactoryLM works right in Telegram - the free messaging app. No software to install, no IT approval needed. Your techs can use it on their phones."
```

**Action:** Open Telegram, show the FactoryLM bot

### Step 2: Photo a Sample Error
```
"Watch this. I'll send a photo of a Siemens fault code..."
```

**Action:** Send a sample PLC error photo

### Step 3: Show the Response
```
"And within about 60 seconds... here's the diagnosis. Probable cause, step-by-step fix, and parts you might need."
```

**Action:** Show the AI response

### Step 4: Highlight Value
```
"What would normally take your team 2-3 hours of manual research just happened in under a minute. And it works with Siemens, Allen-Bradley, ABB, Schneider, Mitsubishi - all the major brands."
```

---

## Handle Objections (2 min)

### "How accurate is it?"
```
"We're seeing 80-85% accuracy in testing. When it's wrong, you can flag it and we prioritize fixing that gap. The AI gets smarter with every diagnosis."
```

### "What about data security?"
```
"Everything's encrypted. We don't store proprietary data. Photos are analyzed and the response is generated - we're not building a database of your equipment. SOC 2 compliance is in progress."
```

### "We already have a CMMS."
```
"Great - FactoryLM isn't replacing your CMMS. It's giving your techs a diagnostic copilot they can use right from their phone. Think of it as the expertise layer on top of your existing workflow."
```

### "What's the catch?"
```
"No catch. We're early stage and looking for maintenance managers willing to give feedback. In exchange, you get in at founder pricing - $99/user/month, which we'll honor even when we raise prices."
```

---

## Close (3 min)

### Trial Offer
```
"Here's what I'd like to propose: a 30-day pilot for your team. You'd get full access to FactoryLM for [X] technicians. 

I'll personally onboard each tech - takes about 15 minutes - and we'll do weekly check-ins so I can hear what's working and what needs improvement.

At the end of 30 days, if it's not saving you time, no hard feelings. If it is, we continue at $99/user/month.

Does that sound reasonable?"
```

### Get Commitment
```
"What would it take to get started? Who else needs to sign off?"
```

**Listen for:**
- Decision maker confirmation
- Timeline
- Blockers

### Schedule Next Step
```
"Great. Let's schedule the onboarding call. How does [specific day/time] work for you and your lead tech?"
```

- [ ] Send follow-up email with:
  - Thank you
  - Recap of what you discussed
  - Calendly link for onboarding
  - Pricing confirmation
