## Email Template A: Direct Problem

**Subject:** Faster PLC diagnostics for [Company]?

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: when your maintenance team hits an unfamiliar PLC fault code, what's the typical process?

I ask because I've built an AI tool that diagnoses PLC errors from photos in under 90 seconds — no manuals, no phone calls, no waiting.

Maintenance managers using it report 2-4 hours saved per incident.

Worth a 10-minute demo?

## Email Template B: Specific Insight

**Subject:** That Siemens fault code problem

```
Hi [First Name],

I've been talking to maintenance managers in [industry], and the same problem keeps coming up:

Unfamiliar PLC fault codes → hours of manual digging → expensive downtime.

One manager told me a Siemens S7 intermittent fault took his team 4 hours to diagnose. Our AI caught it in 90 seconds by correlating the error code with voltage fluctuation patterns.

If your team runs into diagnostic delays, I'd love to show you what we're building.

15 minutes — no obligation.

## 3-Email Follow-Up Sequence

### Follow-Up #1 (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: Faster PLC diagnostics for [Company]?

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note about FactoryLM.

Wanted to share a quick stat: the average maintenance team spends 3.2 hours per week on diagnostic delays. That's over 160 hours per year — per technician.

Our AI cuts that to minutes.

Would a quick call make sense?

### Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)
**Subject:** One more thought

```
[First Name],

Last follow-up, I promise.

If PLC diagnostics aren't a pain point for your team, no worries — ignore this.

But if you've ever had a technician stuck on an unfamiliar fault code while equipment sits idle... that's exactly what we solve.

Happy to do a 10-minute demo whenever works.

### Follow-Up #3 (Day 14) — Breakup Email
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing this isn't a priority right now.

No problem — I'll close out your file.

If diagnostic delays ever become a headache, here's where to find me: [website]

Best of luck,
