Hi [Name],

Thanks for being one of our first FactoryLM customers. Your feedback has been invaluable.

Quick ask: Would you be willing to provide a short testimonial I can use on our website?

Just 2-3 sentences about how FactoryLM has helped your team. Something like:

"Before FactoryLM, [problem]. Now, [benefit]. It's saved us [result]."

If you're comfortable, I'd love to include your name and company. If not, anonymous is fine too.

Thanks,
Mike
