4. "How often do unfamiliar PLC errors occur? Weekly? Monthly?"

**Current Solution (3 min):**
5. "What tools or resources do your techs currently use to diagnose PLC issues?"
6. "Any software you've tried for this? What worked/didn't work?"

**Solution Validation (5 min):**

## Outreach Templates

### LinkedIn Connection Request
```
Hi [Name], noticed you manage maintenance at [Company]. I'm researching how manufacturing teams diagnose PLC issues — would love 15 minutes of your time to learn about your challenges. No pitch, just research. Mind if I connect?
```

### Follow-Up DM (after connection)
```
Thanks for connecting! Quick question: when your team hits an unfamiliar PLC error code, what's the typical process? I'm building an AI diagnostic tool and want to make sure I'm solving a real problem. Would you have 15 min this week for a quick call?
```
