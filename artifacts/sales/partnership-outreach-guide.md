## Outreach Templates

### Distributor Outreach (Email)

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity — FactoryLM + [Distributor]

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Distributor] serves many of the same 
industrial customers we're helping at FactoryLM.

Quick context: FactoryLM is an AI diagnostic tool that helps 
maintenance teams diagnose PLC errors in 60 seconds via photo. 
We're working with [X] manufacturers in [region] and seeing 
strong results.

I think there's a partnership opportunity:
- Your customers buy PLCs and automation equipment
- When they have problems, FactoryLM can help them solve issues fast
- You could offer this as a value-add, earning referral revenue

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore?

### System Integrator Outreach (LinkedIn)

**Connection Request:**
```
Hi [Name], I see you run [Company] doing automation work in [area]. 
I'm building AI diagnostic tools for maintenance teams — would love 
to connect and see if there's synergy.
```

**Follow-up DM:**
```
Thanks for connecting! Quick question: Do your customers ever call 
you for help troubleshooting PLC issues after installation?

I ask because I'm building FactoryLM — AI that diagnoses PLC errors 
from photos in 60 seconds. Some integrators are bundling it into 
their service contracts.

Would you be open to a quick call to see if this could work for 
[Company]?
```

THE OPPORTUNITY:
