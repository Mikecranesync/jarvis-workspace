You've been using FactoryLM for [X] weeks now, and I really appreciate your feedback along the way.

Quick favor: Would you be willing to share a short testimonial I can use on our website?

Just 2-3 sentences covering:

Something like:

If you're comfortable, I'd include your name, title, and company. If you prefer anonymous, that works too.

Thanks for being one of our first customers!

## Testimonial Formats

### Short Quote (Website hero)
```
"FactoryLM cut our diagnostic time from hours to minutes. Game changer."
— John M., Maintenance Manager, ABC Manufacturing
```

### Medium Quote (Features page)
```
"We had a Siemens S7 fault that stumped our team for 3 hours. 
FactoryLM diagnosed it in 90 seconds. That's $1,500 in downtime we didn't lose."
— Sarah K., Plant Manager, XYZ Industries
```

### Long Quote (Case study)
```
"Before FactoryLM, every unfamiliar error code meant digging through 
manuals or waiting on hold with the vendor. Our techs were frustrated, 
and we were losing production time.

Now, they just snap a photo and get the answer in a minute. 
It's like having a senior tech on call 24/7.

In the first month, we avoided at least 3 extended diagnostic delays. 
At our downtime cost, that's easily $5,000 saved. The ROI was immediate."

— Mike Johnson, Maintenance Manager
   Precision Manufacturing Co.
   Orlando, FL
