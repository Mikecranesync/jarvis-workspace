## ICP Decision Required

### Option A: SMB Maintenance Managers
**Profile:**
- Company size: 50-200 employees
- Role: Maintenance Manager or Plant Manager
- Team: 3-5 maintenance technicians
- Budget: Can approve $500-2,000/month

**Pros:**
- Faster sales cycle (2-4 weeks)
- Direct decision maker access
- Clear pain point (no reliability engineer)
- Can start with 1-2 techs

**Cons:**
- Lower deal size ($49-99/month × 3-5 users = $150-500 MRR)
- Need more customers to hit $5K MRR

### Option B: Independent Maintenance Contractors
**Profile:**
- 2-5 person shops
- Multi-client service model
- Diverse equipment exposure
- Higher willingness-to-pay (bills clients)

**Pros:**
- Higher per-user value (saves billable time)
- Word-of-mouth to their clients
- Diverse PLC exposure = better training data

**Cons:**
- Fragmented market (harder to find)
- Inconsistent usage patterns
- May not have recurring budget

## Recommendation

**Start with Option A (SMB Maintenance Managers)** because:
1. Easier to find and target via LinkedIn
2. More predictable usage patterns
3. Better case study material (named companies)
4. Can expand to contractors later

**Specific ICP:**
> Maintenance Managers at discrete manufacturers in Orlando/Central Florida with 50-200 employees, 3-5 person maintenance teams, running Siemens/Allen-Bradley/ABB PLCs, experiencing 2+ hours of diagnostic delays per month.
