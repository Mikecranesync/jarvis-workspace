# Friday Launch Post - Build in Public

## LinkedIn Version (Primary)

---

**I'm building something crazy this weekend.**

A pocket-sized AI expert for factories.

Here's the plan:
→ Plug a $50 device into any industrial network
→ WhatsApp a phone number
→ Ask it what's wrong with your equipment — in any language
→ It tells you. No internet required.

By Tuesday, I'll have a working demo.

Why? Because Venezuela is rebuilding its oil industry. They need maintenance expertise that:
- Works offline (infrastructure is unreliable)
- Speaks Spanish (duh)
- Costs almost nothing (economy is recovering)

So I'm building it.

The tech stack:
🔧 BeagleBone edge computer
🧠 Local LLM for diagnostics
📱 WhatsApp for the interface
🏭 Factory I/O for training data

Follow along. I'll post daily updates.

If this works, it could change how the developing world maintains industrial equipment.
