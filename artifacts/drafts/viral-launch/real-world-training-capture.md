**Context:** Mike is at work operating crane equipment. These are real conversations captured during training/operations.

## Raw Captures (Transcribed)

### Capture 1 - 04:24 UTC
> "Right then you go over to me. Now you have the option cuz all requirements were met. You have the option to confirm the reset... We'll see them on this box. We're doing it now... He'll let me know when you're getting yeah all those three green check marks have to be there right? Will you set me block? Will you reset blocks you go into Auto activate the zone and I'll get a two unoccupied once you get that switching into maintenance..."

**Key Terms:**
- Requirements met → confirm reset
- Three green check marks
- Set/reset blocks
- Auto-activate zone
- Unoccupied status
- Switching to maintenance mode

### Capture 2 - 04:26 UTC
> "Really two of your zones are not on extract track. Sean on there. Oh the station station restart okay now they can. You already did it. Okay can I take a pause? So is it basically the case that anytime a button is flashing you need to push it?"

**Key Terms:**
- Zones on extract track
- Station restart
- Flashing buttons = action needed

## Content Potential

This is REAL industrial operator training. The exact use case for ShopTalk/FactoryLM.

**Pain Points Visible:**
1. Complex multi-step procedures
2. Multiple zones to track
3. Status indicators (green checks, flashing buttons)
4. Maintenance mode switching
5. Training new operators

**Content Angle:**
> "I was literally operating a crane at 4 AM when I realized - this is exactly what AI should help with. The zones, the buttons, the status checks. What if an operator could just ASK the machine what to do next?"

## Future Capture Ideas

1. End-of-shift recap: "What confused me tonight"
2. Training moments: "Explaining this to a new operator"
3. Problem moments: "Something went wrong, here's how we fixed it"

*This is gold. Real operators, real language, real problems.*
