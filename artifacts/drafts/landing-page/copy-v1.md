## PROBLEM SECTION

### Section headline
**Why 70% of CMMS Implementations Fail**

### Problem 1
**Technicians Don't Use It**

Your team didn't buy the software. They don't want to learn another system. So they use clipboards instead.

### Problem 2
**No Connection to Real Equipment**

Your CMMS tracks work orders. Your PLCs track machine health. They never talk to each other.

### Problem 3
**Data Goes In, Nothing Useful Comes Out**

You've got years of maintenance history. But when a pump fails at 2 AM, you're still Googling error codes.
