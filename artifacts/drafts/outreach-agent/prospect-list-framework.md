## Next Steps

1. **Mike to run LinkedIn searches** (or delegate to VA)
2. **Fill in 50 actual contacts** using this framework
3. **Add to outreach CRM** (Mautic or separate)
4. **Start outreach sequence** using cold email template

---

## Note from Jarvis

I can't access LinkedIn directly to pull actual contact names, but this framework gives you:
- 50 target companies across 5 industries
- Exact search queries to use
- Scoring criteria for prioritization
- Process for building the actual list

If you have LinkedIn Sales Navigator, this can be completed in 1-2 hours.

**Alternatively:** Services like Apollo.io or ZoomInfo can provide direct exports of contacts matching these criteria for ~$100-200.
