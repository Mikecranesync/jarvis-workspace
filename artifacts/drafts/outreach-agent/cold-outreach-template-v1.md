## Primary Template (Email)

**Subject:** Quick question about [COMPANY NAME] maintenance

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Saw you're leading maintenance at [COMPANY NAME] — quick question:

When a machine throws a cryptic fault code, how long does your team spend hunting for the answer?

I ask because I'm building a tool that translates PLC fault codes into plain English. Instead of digging through manuals for "ERR 47," technicians get: "Drive overcurrent on axis 2. Check motor thermal history."

Early users are cutting diagnostic time by 60%.

**Not selling anything yet** — just looking for feedback from experienced maintenance leaders like yourself.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to tell me what's broken in the tools you use today? Happy to share what I've learned from other plants in return.

Best,
Mike Harper
FactoryLM

P.S. [PERSONALIZATION: Recent news about their company, industry trend, or LinkedIn post they made]

## Variant B: LinkedIn Connection Request

---

Hi [FIRST NAME] — I'm building AI that translates PLC fault codes into plain English for maintenance teams. 

Noticed you're at [COMPANY NAME]. Would love to connect and get your perspective on what's broken in current diagnostic tools.

Not selling — just learning.

## Variant C: LinkedIn Message (After Connection)

---

Thanks for connecting, [FIRST NAME].

Quick context: I'm working on AI that helps maintenance teams diagnose faults faster. The kind of thing where "F0091" becomes "Servo overcurrent — check axis 3 binding."

Two questions if you have 30 seconds:

1. What's the most time-consuming part of diagnosing equipment issues?
2. Any tools you've tried that almost worked but fell short?

No pitch, just trying to understand the problem better.

Thanks,
Mike

## Variant D: Follow-up Email (7 days after no response)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about [COMPANY NAME] maintenance

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Following up on my note from last week. Totally understand if now's not the right time.

TL;DR: Building AI for maintenance diagnostics, looking for feedback from people who actually do the job.

15 minutes of your insight would be incredibly valuable. Happy to work around your schedule.

Either way — hope you're having a good week.

Mike

## Personalization Ideas

Use ONE of these in the P.S.:

1. **Company news:** "P.S. Congrats on the [RECENT EXPANSION/PROJECT] — sounds like a lot of new equipment to keep running."

2. **LinkedIn activity:** "P.S. Your post about [TOPIC] resonated — dealing with that exact problem."

3. **Industry angle:** "P.S. Heard [INDUSTRY TREND] is hitting your sector hard — curious how it's affecting your team."

4. **Mutual connection:** "P.S. [NAME] mentioned you're one of the sharpest maintenance minds they know."

5. **Local angle:** "P.S. Saw you're based in [CITY] — I'm in Florida but visit the area occasionally."

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- Keep under 150 words
- Lead with a question
- Focus on their pain, not your product
- Use "feedback" framing (not "demo")
- Include specific examples (fault codes)
- Follow up exactly once

### Don't:
- Attach anything
- Use corporate jargon
- Mention pricing
- Ask for a "demo" or "call to learn more about your needs"
- Send more than 2 follow-ups
- Use fake urgency ("limited spots")

---

## CTA Options (Soft)

1. "Would you be open to a 15-minute call?"
2. "Any chance you'd share your perspective?"
3. "Could I ask you 2 quick questions?"
4. "Would a quick chat be useful?"

Avoid: "Let me show you a demo" / "Can we schedule a call to discuss your needs?"
