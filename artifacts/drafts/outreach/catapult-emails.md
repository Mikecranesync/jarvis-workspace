# Catapult Lakeland Outreach Emails

**Context:** Mike is a Catapult member - these are warm introductions, not cold outreach.

## EMAIL 1: Josh Frost (Fine Line Machine)

**Subject:** Fellow Catapult member + CNC maintenance question

---

Hey Josh,

I'm Mike Harper - fellow Catapult member working out of the workspace. Congrats on the 4-year milestone at Fine Line Machine! The growth from Catapult makerspace to a 6,000 sq ft facility doing aerospace/defense work is impressive.

I'm building something you might find interesting: **FactoryLM** - an AI-powered maintenance system for manufacturing equipment. Think predictive maintenance for CNC machines that catches problems before they cause downtime.

Given you're running 4 machines and moving toward 5-axis and AS9100, I'm curious:

1. How are you currently tracking equipment maintenance and machine health?
2. Are unplanned machine failures a pain point for you?

I'd love to buy you a coffee at Catapult and pick your brain on what maintenance headaches look like for a precision shop like yours. No pitch - just trying to understand the problem better from someone actually running machines.

Free any day this week?

## EMAIL 2: Joshua Sitta (Sittadel)

**Subject:** Industrial IoT security + Catapult connection

---

Joshua,

Mike Harper here - Catapult workspace member. Just saw the Florida Poly partnership announcement for the student SOC - that's a huge win for keeping tech talent in Polk County.

I'm building **FactoryLM** - an industrial AI platform that helps factories predict equipment failures. Our edge devices connect to PLCs and industrial equipment, which brings up an interesting challenge: **industrial cybersecurity**.

Most factory systems were never designed to be connected. Now we're putting smart devices on them, and OT security becomes critical.

I'm curious if this is something Sittadel has explored - the intersection of IoT, industrial control systems, and cyber defense. I'd love to chat about:

1. What you're seeing in industrial/OT security
2. Whether there's potential partnership opportunities
3. General advice from someone who's built a successful Lakeland tech company

Would you be open to a 20-minute call or coffee at Catapult?

## EMAIL 3: Dave Pappas (Creative/Video)

**Subject:** Quick question about AI + video at Catapult

---

Hey Dave,

I'm Mike - work out of Catapult workspace. Saw your post about wrestling with AI as a creative and wanted to reach out.

I'm building an industrial AI company (FactoryLM) and we're at the point where we need to create demo videos, case studies, and content. Your background in independent film caught my eye.

Two things I'm curious about:

1. Are you available for freelance video work? We'd need a 60-second demo video and potentially ongoing content.

2. On the AI discussion - I'm on the other side of it (building AI tools). Would be interesting to hear a creative's perspective over coffee.

What's your current project load look like?

## EMAIL 4: Catapult Staff (Experts in Residence)

**Subject:** Looking for manufacturing/tech mentor

---

Hi [Catapult Staff Name],

I'm Mike Harper - workspace member building FactoryLM, an AI platform for industrial maintenance.

I'm looking for mentorship in a few specific areas:

1. **Manufacturing/Industrial sales** - How to sell to factories and maintenance managers
2. **Hardware/IoT** - We're building edge devices that connect to industrial equipment
3. **Enterprise SaaS** - B2B sales cycles, pricing, contracts

Are there any Experts in Residence at Catapult with manufacturing, industrial, or enterprise tech backgrounds? I'd love to get connected.

Also curious if FactoryLM would be a good fit for the Launch program - we're at the point where some funding would accelerate our pilot deployments.

Thanks,
Mike Harper

Hey [Name],

Just floating this back up - totally understand if you're slammed.

Quick reminder: I'm the FactoryLM guy at Catapult looking to [specific ask from original email].

If timing's not right, no worries at all. But if you have 15 minutes in the next couple weeks, I'd love to connect.
