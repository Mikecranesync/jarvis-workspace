## Post 1: The PLC Intelligence Gap (Thought Leadership)

**Hook:** Most "AI" maintenance tools don't actually understand your PLCs.

---

They see sensor data. They see alarms. They see work orders.

But do they know what F0401 means on your Siemens G120C?

Do they understand why your Allen-Bradley L8 keeps throwing that intermittent fault?

Here's the truth: Generic AI is trained on generic data.

Your factory isn't generic.

Your PLCs have decades of tribal knowledge baked into their programs.
Your techs have developed intuition from thousands of hours of troubleshooting.

Most maintenance AI ignores all of that.

At FactoryLM, we're building something different:
AI that actually speaks PLC.

Not just "anomaly detected."
But "this fault pattern matches the bearing failure you fixed in 2019."

That's the intelligence gap we're closing.

What's your biggest frustration with current maintenance software?

## Post 2: The Cost of "I've Seen This Before" (Pain Point)

**Hook:** Your best maintenance tech just retired.

---

30 years of experience.
Thousands of repairs.
Every weird noise, every intermittent fault, every "trick" that isn't in any manual.

Gone.

And now your junior techs are starting from scratch.

This is the #1 hidden cost in industrial maintenance: **knowledge loss**.

Industry stats say 10,000 Baby Boomers retire every day.
Manufacturing is getting hit harder than most.

The question isn't IF you'll lose institutional knowledge.
It's whether you're capturing it before it walks out the door.

Here's what I'm building: a system that turns every work order into searchable knowledge. Every fix becomes a training resource. Every diagnosis gets smarter.

Not to replace techs. To multiply them.

Who's the maintenance legend at your facility? What would you lose if they left tomorrow?

## Post 3: 70% of "Predictive Maintenance" Projects Fail (Contrarian)

**Hook:** Hot take: Most predictive maintenance implementations are expensive sensors collecting dust.

---

I've seen it too many times:

✅ Bought the fancy vibration sensors
✅ Connected everything to the cloud
✅ Got the beautiful dashboards
❌ Actually prevented zero failures

Why?

Because predictive maintenance isn't about the sensors.
It's about what you DO with the data.

The companies that succeed:
→ Start with one critical asset, not the whole plant
→ Define clear thresholds BEFORE installing sensors
→ Train their techs to act on alerts, not ignore them
→ Measure ROI relentlessly

The companies that fail:
→ Buy enterprise software they don't need
→ Try to boil the ocean on day one
→ Never connect predictions to work orders
→ Treat it as an IT project, not a maintenance project

What's your predictive maintenance horror story? Or success story?

## Post 4: Photo → Diagnosis (Product Demo)

**Hook:** Imagine this: Your tech snaps a photo of an error code. AI tells them exactly what's wrong.

---

That's not science fiction. That's what we're building.

Here's the workflow:

1. Tech sees unfamiliar fault code
2. Opens app, takes photo
3. AI identifies the code, the equipment, the context
4. Returns: probable causes, repair steps, parts needed
5. Links to similar past repairs at YOUR facility

No more:
❌ Digging through 500-page manuals
❌ Calling the "one guy who knows"
❌ Googling error codes and hoping for the best

The future of maintenance isn't replacing technicians.
It's giving them superhuman memory.

Would instant diagnostics change how your team works?

## Post 5: Why I'm Building This (Origin Story)

**Hook:** 20 years in industrial maintenance taught me one thing:

---

The best technicians aren't the ones with the most certifications.

They're the ones who remember.

They remember the time that motor sounded "off" and caught the bearing before it seized.

They remember the trick to reset that PLC without losing the program.

They remember which vendor actually shows up when you need them.

That knowledge is priceless. And it's disappearing.

I started FactoryLM because I watched too many plants lose too much when experienced techs retired.

We're not building another CMMS.
We're building industrial memory.

Every work order becomes a lesson.
Every diagnosis becomes searchable.
Every fix makes the whole team smarter.

Because the best technician should be available to everyone, all the time.

That's the mission.

Who's with me?
