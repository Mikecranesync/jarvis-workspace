# Week 5 (Mar 4) — Downtime Costs

That 2 AM phone call cost us $47,000.

Here's the breakdown:

The call came in at 2:17 AM. Conveyor down. Line stopped.

By the time I got there, diagnosed the problem, sourced an emergency part, and got things running again — 6 hours had passed.

The real cost:
- Lost production: $32,000
- Emergency parts markup: $8,500  
- Overtime labor: $4,200
- Expedited shipping: $2,300

Total: $47,000. For a bearing that should have been replaced during last month's PM.

The maintenance budget we'd been asking for? $35,000/year.

That one failure cost more than an entire year of prevention.

This is the math that changed how our leadership thinks about maintenance. Not "cost center." Investment.

What's your most expensive unplanned downtime story?
