5 reasons your technicians hate the CMMS.

(And how to fix each one)

I've watched this movie before. New system rolls out. Training happens. Six months later, everyone's back to clipboards.

Here's why:

**1. Too many clicks**
→ If logging a work order takes 15 taps, they'll skip it. Streamline the mobile workflow to 3-4 taps max.

**2. The mobile app is garbage**
→ If they have to pinch and zoom on a desktop interface, you've already lost. Demand a real mobile app.

**3. Training was a one-time event**
→ A 2-hour session doesn't stick. Build quick reference cards. Do monthly refreshers. Celebrate wins.

**4. It doesn't help them do their job**
→ If the system just creates more paperwork without giving value back (history, manuals, parts info), why would they use it?

**5. Leadership doesn't use the data**
→ If techs log everything and nothing changes, they stop logging. Show them their input drives decisions.

The pattern I see:

Companies that succeed don't just implement software.

They implement habits.

Daily standups using CMMS data.
Weekly reviews of completed work orders.
Monthly recognition for documentation leaders.

Which of these 5 hits closest to home for you?
