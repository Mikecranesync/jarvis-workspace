# Week 11 (Apr 15) — Case Study

How we cut unplanned downtime 40% in 90 days.

**Where we started:**
- 12+ emergency calls per month
- Average response time: 4 hours
- No PM schedule (or one nobody followed)
- Techs working off memory and sticky notes

**What we changed:**

Week 1-4: **Foundation**
- Audited every asset
- Loaded critical equipment into CMMS
- Set up basic PM schedules

Week 5-8: **Habits**
- Daily 15-min standup using CMMS data
- Every work order logged, no exceptions
- Started tracking failure causes

Week 9-12: **Optimization**
- Adjusted PM frequencies based on actual data
- Created quick-reference guides for common failures
- Recognized top documentation contributors

**The results:**
- Emergency calls: 12 → 7 per month
- Response time: 4 hours → 1.5 hours
- Unplanned downtime: Down 40%

**The secret?**
No magic software. No expensive consultants.

Just consistency. Small improvements. Every day.
