# Week 7 (Mar 18) — ROI Framework

How to justify your maintenance budget (without begging).

Save this for your next budget meeting.

**Step 1: Calculate true downtime cost**
- Lost production per hour × average downtime hours
- Don't forget overtime, scrap, and customer penalties

**Step 2: Track avoided failures**
- Every PM that catches a problem = avoided emergency
- Estimate what that failure would have cost
- Keep a running total

**Step 3: Document parts savings**
- Planned purchases vs emergency markup
- Bulk discounts from predictable ordering
- Reduced expedited shipping

**Step 4: Present in business terms**
- "We prevented 12 unplanned shutdowns"
- "Saved $180K in avoided downtime"
- "Reduced parts costs 23%"

Leadership doesn't care about wrench time or PM completion rates.

They care about money saved and production protected.

Speak their language.
