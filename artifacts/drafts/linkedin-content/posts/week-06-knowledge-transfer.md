# Week 6 (Mar 11) — Knowledge Transfer

My best technician retired last month.

We lost 30 years of knowledge.

He knew things nobody else did:
- Which pump makes "that sound" before it fails
- The trick to calibrating line 3's sensor
- Why we never run machine 7 above 80%

None of it was documented. All of it was in his head.

We thought we had time. We didn't.

What we're doing differently now:

1. **Video everything** — 5-minute recordings of experienced techs explaining their tricks
2. **Shadow shifts** — New techs paired with veterans for 90 days minimum  
3. **Living documents** — Equipment notes that get updated after every repair
4. **Exit interviews** — 2 weeks of knowledge capture before anyone retires

The CMMS should be a knowledge base, not just a work order system.

How are you preserving institutional knowledge before it walks out the door?
