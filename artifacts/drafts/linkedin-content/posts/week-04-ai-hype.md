Unpopular opinion: AI won't fix your maintenance problems.

Hear me out.

I've spent 20+ years in industrial maintenance. I've seen every silver bullet come and go.

Now everyone's talking about AI like it's going to magically transform maintenance operations overnight.

It won't.

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear:

**AI amplifies what you already have.**

Good processes? AI makes them better.
Bad processes? AI exposes them faster.
No data? AI has nothing to work with.

I've seen companies spend six figures on "AI-powered" maintenance platforms, only to realize:

- Their equipment data was garbage
- Their work order history was incomplete
- Their techs weren't logging anything useful

AI can't fix that. Only people can.

**What AI CAN do:**

✅ Find patterns humans miss
✅ Predict failures from sensor data
✅ Suggest diagnoses based on similar cases
✅ Make institutional knowledge accessible

But it needs a foundation first.

Before you buy the AI pitch, ask yourself:

1. Is our CMMS data clean?
2. Are we consistently logging work orders?
3. Do we have sensor data worth analyzing?

If you can't say yes to all three, start there.

AI is a force multiplier, not a magic wand.

Am I wrong?
