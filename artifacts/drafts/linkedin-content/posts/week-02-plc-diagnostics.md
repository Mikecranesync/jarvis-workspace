# LinkedIn Post — Week 2 (Feb 11)

**Theme:** PLC Diagnostics  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Review

I asked AI to read my PLC fault code.

What happened next changed how I think about maintenance.

It was 2 AM. The line was down. I had a fault code on the screen that I'd never seen before.

I did what we all do:
- Googled it. Found a forum post from 2014. No help.
- Dug through the manual. 400 pages of "refer to section 7.4.2"
- Called the vendor. Got voicemail.

Three hours later, I finally figured it out. A $47,000 problem caused by a $12 sensor.

Last month, same scenario. Different approach.

I pasted the fault code into an AI diagnostic tool. Within seconds:
- Probable cause identified
- Three possible fixes ranked by likelihood
- Links to the exact manual pages I needed

10 minutes to diagnosis. Not 3 hours.

I'm not saying AI replaces experience. It doesn't.

But it does amplify it. The senior tech's knowledge, captured and accessible at 2 AM when he's not there.

Would you trust AI with your fault codes?

I used to be skeptical. Now I'm a convert.
