# Week 10 (Apr 8) — Future of Maintenance

What maintenance looks like in 2030. (And how to prepare now.)

**AI-assisted diagnostics**
Your CMMS will read fault codes and suggest fixes before you even get to the machine. Not replacing experience — amplifying it.

**AR glasses on every tech**
Manuals, schematics, work history — floating in your field of view. Hands stay on the job.

**Predictive everything**
Sensors + AI = knowing a bearing will fail 3 weeks before it does. Planned downtime replaces emergency calls.

**Remote expertise**
A specialist in Ohio helps troubleshoot a machine in Texas via video. Travel drops, response time improves.

**The human element remains**
AI suggests. Humans decide. The best techs will be the ones who know how to work WITH intelligent tools.

**How to prepare:**

1. Get your data house in order NOW
2. Start logging everything — AI needs history
3. Experiment with tools while stakes are low
4. Train your team to embrace change, not fear it

The future isn't coming. It's here. The question is whether you'll lead or catch up.

What's your prediction for maintenance in 2030?
