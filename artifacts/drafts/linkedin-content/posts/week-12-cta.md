# Week 12 (Apr 22) — Call to Action

I'm building something for maintenance teams who are tired of fighting their CMMS.

After 20+ years in industrial maintenance, I've seen the same problems everywhere:
- Software that techs won't use
- No connection to actual equipment
- Data goes in, nothing useful comes out

So I'm building FactoryLM.

**What makes it different:**

🤖 **PLC Copilot** — Paste a fault code, get a diagnosis in plain English. AI that actually helps.

📱 **Mobile-first CMMS** — Built for techs, not admins. 3 taps to log a work order.

👓 **Smart glasses** — Manuals and schematics hands-free. (Coming soon.)

🧠 **It learns** — Every repair makes the system smarter. Your institutional knowledge, preserved.

**I'm looking for:**
- Maintenance managers tired of failed implementations
- Reliability engineers drowning in bad data
- Anyone who's ever Googled a fault code at 2 AM

We're opening early access to the first 50 teams.

If this sounds like what you need, join the waitlist: [factorylm.com]

Or just DM me. I read everything.

Let's fix maintenance together.
