# Week 9 (Apr 1) — Tool Comparison

I've used 6 CMMS platforms in my career. Here's what I learned.

**The good:**
- MaintainX: Best mobile app, techs actually use it
- Limble: Clean interface, great onboarding
- UpKeep: Solid all-rounder, good support

**The frustrating:**
- Fiix: Powerful but complex, steep learning curve
- MP2/Maximo: Enterprise-grade, enterprise-complicated
- Spreadsheets: Where dreams go to die

**What actually matters:**

1. **Mobile-first** — If techs can't log work orders on their phone in 30 seconds, they won't.

2. **Fast implementation** — If it takes 6 months to go live, you've lost momentum.

3. **Visible ROI** — Leadership needs dashboards that show value.

4. **Support quality** — When it breaks at 2 AM, can you get help?

**Red flags:**
- "We'll customize everything for you" (= 18-month implementation)
- No free trial
- Pushy sales, no product demo

Pick the simplest tool that solves your biggest problem. You can always add complexity later.

What's your go-to CMMS?
