# Week 8 (Mar 25) — Safety Culture

The shortcut that almost killed my coworker.

We were behind schedule. Pressure from above. The machine needed a quick adjustment.

Instead of locking out, he reached in. "Just takes a second."

The guard wasn't fully engaged. The machine cycled.

He lost two fingers. Could have been his arm. Could have been his life.

What I learned:

**1. Pressure creates shortcuts**
When leadership pushes production over safety, this happens. Culture starts at the top.

**2. Procedures exist because someone got hurt**
Every LOTO step, every safety check — someone's injury wrote that rule.

**3. Speaking up is hard but necessary**
I saw him reach in. I didn't say anything fast enough. That haunts me.

**4. Near-misses are gifts**
Report them. Learn from them. Don't wait for the injury.

Now I stop the job. Every time. No exceptions.

Seconds saved are never worth a life changed.

What's your safety lesson?
