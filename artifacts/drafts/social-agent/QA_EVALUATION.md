## Chain of Thought

1. **Relevance check:** Post discusses CMMS implementation failures, which is core to FactoryLM's value proposition. The 3 reasons for failure align with problems FactoryLM solves. ✅

2. **Tone check:** Uses "I've seen it" (personal experience), numbered lists, bold highlights. Professional but not stiff. Appropriate for LinkedIn B2B audience. ✅

3. **CTA check:** Ends with direct question "What's been your experience?" and explicit "Drop your story below". Strong engagement prompt. ✅

4. **Confidentiality check:** No customer names, no proprietary data, no internal metrics. Safe to publish. ✅

5. **Grammar check:** Scanned for errors. "Garbage in, garbage out" is intentional casual phrase, acceptable. No typos. ✅

6. **Length check:** 198 words. LinkedIn optimal is 150-300 words. Perfect range. ✅

## VERDICT: ✅ PASS

**Recommendation:** Approve for Mike's review and publication.

**Suggested improvements (optional):**
- Could add a specific stat/source for "70%" claim if available
- Consider adding an image (CMMS screenshot or frustrated tech meme)
