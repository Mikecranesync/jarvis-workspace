**Title:** The Uncomfortable Truth About CMMS

**Body:**

Here's a stat that should concern every maintenance leader:

More than 50% of CMMS implementations fail.

Not because the software is bad. Not because the vendor lied.

They fail because of three completely preventable issues:

**1. Garbage In, Garbage Out**
Teams rush to digitize without standardizing their data first. Duplicate assets. Inconsistent naming. Missing histories. Your CMMS can only be as good as the data you feed it.

**2. Training Gets Skipped**
"It's intuitive, the team will figure it out."

Famous last words. Six months later, half the technicians are still using paper because nobody showed them the mobile app.

**3. No Clear Objectives**
What does success look like? Reduced downtime? Better compliance? Lower parts inventory?

If you can't answer that before implementation, you definitely can't answer it after.

The fix isn't buying better software. It's doing the boring work first:
- Clean your data
- Train your people  
- Define your goals

Then the software actually has a chance.
