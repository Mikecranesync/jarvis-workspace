**Title:** Why 70% of CMMS Implementations Fail (And What Actually Works)

**Body:**

I've seen it too many times.

A company buys a shiny new CMMS. Six months later, technicians are still using clipboards and the software sits unused.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **The software isn't the problem. The implementation is.**

The top 3 reasons CMMS projects fail:

1️⃣ **No technician buy-in** — If the people doing the work weren't involved in choosing or setting up the system, they won't use it. Period.

2️⃣ **Data migration nightmares** — Dumping 10 years of messy spreadsheets into a new system doesn't make them clean. Garbage in, garbage out.

3️⃣ **Overcomplication** — Starting with every feature turned on overwhelms everyone. The best implementations start simple and grow.

What actually works? 

Start with ONE pain point. Maybe it's tracking work orders. Maybe it's parts inventory. Nail that first. Get wins. Build momentum. Then expand.

The companies that succeed with CMMS treat it as a **culture change**, not a software purchase.

What's been your experience? Have you seen a CMMS implementation succeed or fail spectacularly?
