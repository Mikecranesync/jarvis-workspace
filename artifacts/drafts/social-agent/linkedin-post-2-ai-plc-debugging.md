**Title:** Your PLC Already Knows What's Wrong

**Body:**

I've watched experienced technicians spend hours hunting for the cause of a machine fault.

Meanwhile, the PLC was screaming the answer the whole time.

Here's the problem: PLCs generate cryptic fault codes like "F0091" or "ERR 47." To decode them, you need the manual (which nobody can find) or 20 years of tribal knowledge (which is retiring).

Here's what's changing in 2026:

AI can now read PLC fault codes in real-time and translate them into plain English:

"F0091" becomes "Servo drive overcurrent detected on axis 3. Likely causes: mechanical binding, degraded motor windings, or incorrect acceleration parameters."

Even better — it can correlate that fault with historical data:

"This fault occurred 3 times in the last 90 days. Each time preceded by elevated motor temperature. Recommend thermal inspection."

The PLC data was always there. We just didn't have a good way to listen.

The maintenance managers who figure this out first will:
- Cut diagnostic time by 60%+
- Capture tribal knowledge before it walks out the door
- Turn reactive firefighting into proactive prevention

Your equipment is already talking. AI just makes it speak your language.
