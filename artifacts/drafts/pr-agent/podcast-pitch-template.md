## Template A: Industrial/Automation Podcasts

**Subject:** Guest Pitch: AI That Translates PLC Fault Codes (60% Faster Diagnostics)

---

Hi [HOST NAME],

I've been listening to [PODCAST NAME] for a while now, especially loved the episode on [SPECIFIC EPISODE/TOPIC]. Your focus on [WHAT MAKES THE SHOW UNIQUE] resonates with the problems I'm solving.

**The pitch:** I'm building AI that translates cryptic PLC fault codes into plain English — and it's cutting diagnostic time by 60%.

You know the scenario: A machine throws "F0091" and the technician has to dig through a 500-page manual while production waits. Meanwhile, the tribal knowledge to decode that fault is walking out the door as the workforce retires.

We're fixing both problems at once.

**What I could bring to your show:**

- Live demo: I'll diagnose a real PLC fault code in under 60 seconds
- The tribal knowledge crisis: Data on maintenance workforce retirement
- Why existing CMMS implementations fail (and what AI changes)
- First-hand stories from crane/heavy equipment maintenance

**About me:** 
I'm the founder of FactoryLM, previously worked in crane equipment at CraneSync. Currently experimenting with AI wearables (Brilliant Labs smart glasses) for hands-free field maintenance.

Happy to do a pre-call to see if there's a fit.

Best,
Mike Harper

## Template B: Maintenance/Reliability Podcasts

**Subject:** Podcast Guest: Capturing Tribal Knowledge Before It Retires

---

Hi [HOST NAME],

Quick question: How much institutional knowledge walks out the door when a 30-year maintenance veteran retires?

That's the problem I'm obsessed with solving.

I'm Mike Harper, founder of FactoryLM. We're building AI that captures maintenance expertise in a format that actually helps the next generation of technicians — starting with PLC fault code translation.

**Why this matters now:**

- 50%+ of skilled maintenance workers eligible to retire by 2030
- Average time to train a replacement: 3-5 years
- Most CMMS systems capture *what* was done, not *why* or *how*

**What I could discuss:**

1. The tribal knowledge preservation problem (and why it's urgent)
2. How AI changes maintenance diagnostics
3. Why 50% of CMMS implementations fail
4. Building tech for technicians (not against them)

**Credibility:**
- Background in crane/heavy equipment (CraneSync)
- Building PLC Copilot: AI diagnostic assistant
- Real-world pilot results

Would love to share these insights with your audience. Happy to jump on a quick call.

Best,
Mike Harper

## Template C: Founder/Startup Podcasts

**Subject:** From Crane Technician to Industrial AI Founder

---

Hi [HOST NAME],

I'm building the "Grammarly for maintenance."

Quick backstory: I spent years around cranes and heavy equipment. Watched skilled technicians diagnose problems in seconds that would take a newbie hours. Asked myself: what happens when those people retire?

That question turned into FactoryLM.

**The product:** AI that reads PLC fault codes and explains what's wrong in plain English. Instead of hunting through manuals, technicians get: "Servo drive overcurrent on axis 3. Likely causes: mechanical binding or degraded motor windings. Check thermal history."

**The market:** $15B+ maintenance software market. 500K+ maintenance professionals in the US alone. Massive knowledge transfer crisis happening right now.

**The founder angle:**

- Bootstrapping in the industrial AI space
- Selling to maintenance managers (unusual customer profile)
- Building for blue-collar users (different UX challenges)
- Running this alongside other businesses (CraneSync, Harper House Buyers)

I've got stories about building in an unsexy space where the customers still use paper and the WiFi barely works.

Interested?

## Template D: Quick Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Subject:** Re: Guest Pitch — Still interested if you are

---

Hi [HOST NAME],

Following up on my pitch from [DATE]. Totally understand if it's not the right fit — but wanted to bump this in case it got buried.

Quick recap: I'm building AI that translates PLC fault codes for maintenance teams. Happy to share a 2-minute demo video if that's easier than reading a pitch.

Either way, keep up the great work on [PODCAST NAME].

Best,
Mike
