## Mike's Bio for Pitches

**Short (50 words):**
Mike Harper is the founder of FactoryLM, building AI tools for industrial maintenance. With experience in crane/heavy equipment at CraneSync, he's creating "PLC Copilot" — an AI that translates cryptic machine fault codes into plain English, helping maintenance teams diagnose issues 60% faster.

**Long (150 words):**
Mike Harper spent years in the crane and heavy equipment industry before founding FactoryLM, an industrial AI company on a mission to preserve maintenance tribal knowledge.

His flagship product, PLC Copilot, uses AI to translate cryptic PLC fault codes into actionable diagnostics in plain English. Instead of hunting through 500-page manuals for "Error F0091," technicians get immediate context: what's wrong, why it happened, and what to do next.

The problem he's solving is urgent: the skilled maintenance workforce is retiring, taking decades of hard-won knowledge with them. Mike's building AI tools to capture that expertise before it's lost forever.

Based in the US, Mike also runs CraneSync (crane equipment) and Harper House Buyers (real estate). He's an early adopter of AI wearables, currently experimenting with Brilliant Labs smart glasses for hands-free field maintenance.
