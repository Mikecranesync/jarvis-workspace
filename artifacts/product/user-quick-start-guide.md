## Tips for Best Results

### Taking Good Photos

✅ **Do:**
- Get the full error screen in frame
- Make sure text is readable
- Include model/serial number if visible
- Take in good lighting

❌ **Don't:**
- Take blurry photos
- Cut off parts of the screen
- Take at extreme angles
- Use flash if it causes glare

### Adding Context

The more context you provide, the better the diagnosis:

**Good:** "Siemens S7-1200 showing SF light, happened after we added new I/O module"

**Better:** "Siemens S7-1200 CPU 1214C, SF light on, just installed new SM 1223 digital I/O module yesterday, error started this morning"
