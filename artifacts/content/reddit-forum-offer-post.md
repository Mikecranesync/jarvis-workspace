## Offer Post: Free PLC Diagnosis for AI Training

**Title:** Free PLC Error Diagnosis (Helping Train AI Model)

**Body:**
```
Hey r/IndustrialMaintenance community,

I'm Mike, an industrial AI researcher with 20 years in maintenance (mostly cranes and PLCs).

I'm building FactoryLM: an AI that diagnoses PLC error codes from photos in seconds. To make it even smarter, I'm offering **free, instant PLC error diagnoses** for anyone willing to share a photo of their error screen.

**Here's how it works:**
1. You reply to this post (or DM me) with a clear photo of your PLC error screen and some context (PLC brand/model, what happened).
2. I'll feed it to FactoryLM's AI. 
3. You get a diagnosis, probable cause, and troubleshooting steps back within minutes (often seconds).

**No catch. No sales pitch.** I just need more real-world error data to train the AI and make it better for maintenance teams everywhere.

This works for Siemens, Allen-Bradley, ABB, Schneider, Mitsubishi — any major PLC brand.

So, if you're stuck on a cryptic fault code and want a fast, free answer, reply below!

*(Note: I'm not an emergency service. For critical, production-stopping issues, always follow your company's protocols.)*

Looking forward to helping you out and making FactoryLM smarter!

Cheers,
Mike Harper
Founder, FactoryLM

## Engagement Strategy

### Where to Post
- r/IndustrialMaintenance (check rules first)
- r/manufacturing (broader audience)
- Practical Machinist forum (dedicated maintenance section)
- SMRP Exchange (more formal, high-quality leads)

### Rules for Posting
- **Be genuinely helpful:** Offer value, don't just promote.
- **Read sub rules:** Avoid bans. Some communities don't like self-promotion.
- **Respond quickly:** Build trust by being responsive.
- **DM engaged users:** Move conversations to private chat for deeper qualification.

### Follow-up to DMs
```
"Thanks for sending that over! FactoryLM says [diagnosis]. Let me know if that helps.

By the way, if this kind of instant diagnosis is useful, I'm also building a tool specifically for maintenance managers to give their whole team this capability. Would you be open to a quick chat to learn more?"
