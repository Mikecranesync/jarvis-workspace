# FactoryLM — LinkedIn Post Templates

*For regular posting: 3x/week*
*Rotate through these formats*

## Format 1: Problem → Solution (Thought Leadership)

### Template
```
[Hook: Relatable problem statement]

[Expand on the problem - 2-3 sentences]

[Introduce the insight or solution]

[Key takeaways - bullet points]

[Question to drive engagement]

### Example Post
```
Most "AI" maintenance tools don't actually understand your PLCs.

They see sensor data. They see alarms. They see work orders.

But do they know what F0401 means on your Siemens G120C?

The truth: Generic AI is trained on generic data. Your factory isn't generic.

What we're building at FactoryLM is different:
→ AI that actually speaks PLC
→ Not "anomaly detected" — but "this fault pattern matches the bearing failure you fixed in 2019"

What's your biggest frustration with current maintenance software?

## Format 2: Story (Personal Experience)

### Template
```
[Hook: Start with a specific moment]

[Set the scene - what happened]

[The turning point or lesson]

[What you learned or built because of it]

[Call to action or question]

#Hashtags
```

### Example Post
```
At 2 AM, standing in a cold factory, staring at an error code I'd never seen.

No manual. No cell signal. The plant manager breathing down my neck.

I spent 4 hours figuring out a problem that should have taken 10 minutes.

That night I promised myself: No tech should ever feel that alone again.

Today, we're building FactoryLM — AI that gives every technician instant access to 20 years of diagnostic knowledge.

Because 2 AM troubleshooting shouldn't mean starting from scratch.

What's your worst "stuck at the machine" story?

## Format 3: Contrarian Take

### Template
```
[Hot take statement]

[Acknowledge the conventional wisdom]

[Present your counter-argument with evidence]

[What this means for your audience]

[Invitation to discuss]

### Example Post
```
Hot take: Most predictive maintenance implementations are expensive sensors collecting dust.

I've seen it too many times:
✅ Fancy vibration sensors
✅ Cloud dashboards
✅ AI predictions
❌ Actually prevented zero failures

Why?

Because predictive maintenance isn't about the sensors. It's about what you DO with the data.

Companies that succeed:
→ Start with one critical asset, not the whole plant
→ Define clear thresholds BEFORE installing sensors
→ Train techs to act on alerts, not ignore them

What's your predictive maintenance success story? Or horror story?

## Format 4: Poll / Question

### Template
```
[Question that sparks discussion]

Option A
Option B
Option C
Option D

[Brief context for why you're asking]

#Hashtags
```

### Example Post
```
Poll: When your team hits an unfamiliar PLC error code, how long does diagnosis typically take?

A) Less than 30 minutes
B) 30-60 minutes
C) 1-4 hours
D) More than 4 hours (or we call the vendor)

I'm researching this for a project on diagnostic efficiency.

Results might surprise you — I'll share what I learn next week.

### Example Post
```
How to diagnose a Siemens PLC error in under 5 minutes:

1. Check the diagnostic buffer (Online & Diagnostics > Diagnostic Buffer)
2. Note the timestamp and event ID
3. Cross-reference with Siemens error documentation
4. Check the address mentioned — that's where the problem is

Pro tip: If you don't have OB121 in your program, add it. It catches programming errors before they crash the CPU.

Master the diagnostic buffer and you'll solve problems faster than anyone on your team.

Building in public: What we're working on at FactoryLM this week.

→ Adding support for Mitsubishi FX series
→ Improving accuracy on VFD fault codes
→ New onboarding flow for pilot customers

The goal: Cut diagnostic time from hours to minutes.

What PLC brands or equipment types would you most want supported?

## Format 7: Customer Win (After You Have Them)

### Template
```
[The result]

[The challenge they faced]

[How they solved it]

[Quote or specific metric]

[What this proves]

#Hashtags
```

### Example Post
```
"That's $1,200 in downtime we didn't lose."

A maintenance manager told me this after using FactoryLM for the first time.

The situation: Siemens S7 fault that stumped his team for 3 hours.

With FactoryLM: Diagnosed in 90 seconds.

The tool doesn't replace technicians. It multiplies them.

That's what AI in maintenance should look like.
