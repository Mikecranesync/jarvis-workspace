## Slide 1: Title
**FactoryLM**
AI-Powered Diagnostics for Industrial Maintenance

*Mike Harper, Founder*

## Slide 2: Problem
**Diagnostic delays cost manufacturers $500-1,000 per hour**

- Unfamiliar PLC error codes stop production
- Techs spend 2-4 hours digging through manuals
- Tribal knowledge walks out with retiring workers
- Vendor support = long hold times, expensive contracts

*Visual: Clock + money burning*

---

## Slide 3: Solution
**Photo any error → Get diagnosis in 60 seconds**

1. Tech snaps photo of error screen
2. AI analyzes fault code + context
3. Returns diagnosis, fix steps, parts needed

*Visual: Phone → AI → Fix*

## Slide 4: Demo
**[Live demo or video]**

Show actual diagnosis:
- Send photo via Telegram
- AI responds with diagnosis
- Include time stamp (< 90 seconds)
