## About (Long Description)

```
FactoryLM is building the AI brain for industrial maintenance.

Every day, manufacturing plants lose thousands of dollars to equipment failures that could have been prevented. When a senior technician retires, 30 years of knowledge walks out the door.

We're solving both problems.

FactoryLM is an AI platform purpose-built for industrial maintenance:

• Smart Diagnostics — Upload a PLC fault code, get step-by-step troubleshooting in seconds
• Knowledge Capture — Automatically capture every diagnosis so tribal knowledge never leaves  
• Predictive Insights — Pattern detection across your entire maintenance history

Unlike generic AI tools, FactoryLM speaks industrial: Allen-Bradley fault codes, Modbus registers, ladder logic, and more.

We're currently in early access with manufacturing plants across food processing, automotive, and heavy equipment.

The maintenance industry is a $180B+ market stuck in the 1990s. We're bringing it into the AI era.
