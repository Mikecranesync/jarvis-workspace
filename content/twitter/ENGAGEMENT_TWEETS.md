### Question 2: Technical Approach
AI builders: For domain-specific applications, do you prefer:

🔸 Fine-tuning general models
🔸 RAG with specialized knowledge bases  
🔸 Multi-agent architectures
🔸 Hybrid approaches

Building FactoryLM and curious about your strategies.

## Hot Takes

### Hot Take 1: Industry Disruption  
Hot take 🔥

Every factory will have an AI maintenance assistant within 5 years.

The ones who adopt early will have a 20% uptime advantage over competitors.

That's the difference between profit and bankruptcy in manufacturing.

### Hot Take 2: AI Specialization
Another hot take 🌶️

General-purpose AI is table stakes now. The money is in AI that solves SPECIFIC problems really well.

ChatGPT knows everything about nothing. FactoryLM knows everything about factories.

Depth beats breadth.

### Hot Take 3: Build-in-Public
Controversial opinion: 

Building in public is a competitive ADVANTAGE, not a risk.

Your execution matters more than your idea. Plus, transparency builds trust faster than any marketing budget.

Stealth mode is overrated.

### Screenshot 1: Grafana Dashboard
This is what equipment health looks like in real-time 📊

FactoryLM's monitoring dashboard showing 47 pieces of equipment across 3 production lines.

Green = healthy, yellow = attention needed, red = immediate action required.

### Screenshot 2: Terminal Output
The magic happening behind the scenes ✨

FactoryLM processing 10,000+ sensor readings per minute, identifying patterns, and generating maintenance insights.

Each line represents potential downtime prevented.

### Screenshot 3: Architecture Diagram  
Here's how FactoryLM actually works under the hood 🔧

Master of Puppets orchestrates multiple AI agents:
• Data Ingestion Agent
• Pattern Recognition Agent  
• Recommendation Engine
• Alert Manager

### Screenshot 4: First Customer Alert
This screenshot represents a $50K save 💰

FactoryLM detected bearing degradation 72 hours before failure. Scheduled maintenance during planned downtime instead of emergency shutdown.

This is why we're building this.
