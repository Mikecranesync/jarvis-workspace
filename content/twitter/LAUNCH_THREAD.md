# LAUNCH THREAD - FactoryLM Build-in-Public

## Tweet 1: Hook
🚀 I'm building an AI that controls factories. Here's the plan to make $1M.

A thread about FactoryLM and why maintenance automation is about to change everything 👇

## Tweet 2: The Problem
Factory maintenance is broken. 

Equipment fails unexpectedly. Downtime costs $50K/hour. Maintenance teams are reactive, not predictive.

The average factory loses $240M annually to unplanned downtime.

## Tweet 3: Current State
Most factories still use:
• Paper checklists 📋
• Excel spreadsheets 📊  
• "Experience" over data 🤷‍♂️
• Reactive maintenance only 🔥

Meanwhile, the equipment is SCREAMING telemetry data that nobody listens to.

## Tweet 4: What FactoryLM Does
FactoryLM = Factory Language Model

It reads ALL your equipment data (sensors, logs, manuals, work orders) and becomes your maintenance oracle.

Think ChatGPT, but it knows why your pump is vibrating.

## Tweet 5: The Magic
"Why is Line 3 down?"
"Motor bearing temp is 15°C above normal. Replace bearing #XM-4471 within 48 hours to prevent catastrophic failure."

Specific. Actionable. Backed by 10,000 hours of equipment data.

## Tweet 6: Tech Stack - Master of Puppets
Built on "Master of Puppets" - my AI orchestration platform:

🧠 Multiple LLMs working together
🔄 Self-healing workflows  
📊 Real-time data processing
🎯 Domain-specific training

## Tweet 7: Why This Works
Traditional AI tries to be everything to everyone.

FactoryLM is laser-focused on ONE problem: making factories smarter.

Narrow focus = deeper expertise = better results.

## Tweet 8: What's Built So Far
✅ Core LLM pipeline  
✅ Equipment data ingestion
✅ Master of Puppets orchestration
✅ Basic maintenance recommendations
🚧 Real-time monitoring dashboard
🚧 Predictive failure models

## Tweet 9: The Dual Path
Path 1: SaaS for factories ($50K+ ARR per customer)
Path 2: YouTube channel teaching the journey

Document everything. Build in public. Help others while building wealth.

## Tweet 10: Why YouTube Matters
The factory AI market is nascent. 

By teaching the journey:
• Build authority in the space
• Generate inbound leads
• Create another revenue stream
• Help the next generation of builders

## Tweet 11: Week 1 Goals
This week I'm focusing on:
🎯 Real-time dashboard MVP
📊 First customer pilot program  
🎥 YouTube channel setup
📝 Content calendar for build-in-public
💡 Community feedback integration

*Image: Kanban board showing this week's tasks*

---

## Tweet 12: The $1M Plan
Year 1: 5 pilot customers × $60K = $300K ARR
Year 2: 20 customers × $80K = $1.6M ARR  
+ YouTube revenue stream
+ Consulting/speaking opportunities

Conservative but achievable.

## Tweet 13: Why Share This?
Building in public because:
• Accountability drives execution
• Community catches blind spots
• Transparency builds trust  
• Your success inspires others

Plus, the journey is half the value.
