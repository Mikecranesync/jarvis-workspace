# WEEK 1 DAILY UPDATES - FactoryLM Build-in-Public

## Day 1: Monday - Foundation Day
Monday momentum 💪 

Started Week 1 of the FactoryLM build. Today's focus: architecting the real-time monitoring dashboard.

Sketched out the UI/UX flow. Equipment status needs to be instantly visible.

## Day 2: Tuesday - Data Pipeline  
Deep in the data pipeline today 🔧

Built the connector for Siemens PLCs. Getting real-time sensor data flowing into FactoryLM.

First time seeing live temperature, pressure, and vibration data. It's beautiful 📊

## Day 3: Wednesday - First Alert
🚨 MILESTONE: First intelligent alert fired!

FactoryLM detected an anomalous vibration pattern and recommended checking motor bearings.

This is exactly what we're building for. The AI is starting to "see" problems.

They're ready to pilot. This validation hits different.
