# Constitutional Amendment II: No Drift — The 24/7 Factory

**Proposed:** 2026-01-29  
**Status:** PENDING RATIFICATION

---

## The Amendment

> **Every system we build must run itself. Every process must have an agent. No drift from the mission is tolerated.**

---

## Principles

### 1. Zero Drift Tolerance
- The mission is building FactoryLM: the Industrial Maintenance Intelligence Center
- Every task, every agent, every line of code must serve this mission
- If something doesn't contribute to shipping products or generating revenue, question it
- Weekly mission alignment checks to catch drift early

### 2. Agent-First Architecture
- If a process needs monitoring, build an agent for it
- If a task recurs, automate it
- If a system can break, create alerts for it
- Humans design the system; agents run the system

### 3. The Factory Never Sleeps
- This is not a 9-5 operation — it's a 24/7 factory
- Agents work around the clock: monitoring, building, improving
- Mike sleeps; Jarvis does not
- Every morning should have progress, not just plans

### 4. Self-Healing Systems
- Agents detect problems before humans notice
- Automated recovery where possible
- Escalation paths when human judgment is needed
- Post-mortems feed back into better automation

### 5. Traceability
- Every automated action is logged
- Every decision is documented
- Every change is tracked
- No "magic" — anyone can understand what happened and why

| **Agile Agent** | 5 min | Trello backlog, task management |
| **Security Agent** | 1 hour | Vulnerability scanning, access logs |

### Tier 2: Business Operations (Daily/Weekly)
| Agent | Frequency | Mission |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Daily Brief** | 8:30 AM | News, market intel, priorities |

| **Stale Check** | 9:00 AM | Stuck tasks, dead projects |
| **Research Agent** | 4 hours | Competitive intel, opportunities |

### Tier 3: Growth & GTM (To Be Built)
| Agent | Frequency | Mission |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Social Agent** | 3x/day | LinkedIn posts, engagement |
| **Outreach Agent** | Daily | Cold emails, follow-ups |

## Implementation Requirements

### For Every New Feature:
1. ✅ Define the monitoring agent before shipping
2. ✅ Define the success metrics
3. ✅ Define the failure modes and alerts
4. ✅ Define the automated recovery path
5. ✅ Document in the agent registry

### For Every New Process:
1. ✅ Can this be automated? (Default: yes)
2. ✅ What agent owns this?
3. ✅ What's the human escalation path?
4. ✅ How do we measure if it's working?

### Weekly Alignment Check:
- [ ] Are we still on mission?
- [ ] What drifted this week?
- [ ] What agents need adjustment?
- [ ] What's blocking revenue?

## The Long Game: Custom LLM

The ultimate goal is a pre-trained, domain-specific industrial maintenance LLM. This requires:

1. **Data Collection** — Every interaction, every work order, every diagnosis
2. **Knowledge Graphs** — Per-machine, per-factory, federated learning
3. **Continuous Training** — The model improves with every technician interaction
4. **Edge Deployment** — Run locally on glasses, gateways, embedded devices

The agents we build today collect the data we train on tomorrow.

## Ratification

This amendment requires Mike's explicit approval.

Upon ratification:
- Add to CONSTITUTION.md
- Create Trello board for agent fleet
- Begin building Tier 3 agents immediately

*"A factory that requires constant human attention is just a very expensive workshop. A factory that runs itself is a money machine."*
