# FactoryLM Foundational Concept
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08  
**Status:** CANONICAL — Do not lose this.

## The One-Liner
**"We don't sell software. We sell uptime."**

---

## Core Positioning (YC-Aligned 2026)

YC's 2026 Request for Startups calls out:
1. **Agentic AI** — agents that act, not just advise
2. **AI-native service companies** — "sell results, not software"
3. **Vertical stacks** — like HVAC repair, field service, industrial maintenance

**FactoryLM is all three.**

## The Architecture Philosophy

### Intelligence Flows Downward
```
Layer 3: Cloud (optional) — big models, training
    ↓
Layer 2: Local GPU — air-gapped inference
    ↓
Layer 1: Edge LLM (Pi) — real-time decisions
    ↓
Layer 0: Code + KB — THE GOAL
```

**Key Rule:** Every AI answer gets converted to deterministic code. The goal is Layer 0 — code that runs without AI, learned FROM AI.

### The PLC is the Brain
- We don't monitor factories from outside
- We integrate WITH the control layer
- If you want AI to help, it needs to be IN the brain

## Business Model

| Competitors | FactoryLM |
|-------------|-----------|
| $500K+ deployments | $30/device/month |
| Sell software licenses | Sell uptime results |
| Per-seat pricing | Per-device pricing |
| Enterprise only | SMB accessible |
| Cloud dependent | Edge-first |
| External sensors | Native PLC integration |

## The Differentiator

**We're not building tools for technicians. We're building the technician.**

- Vision AI reads the machine
- Telegram interface dispatches work
- Closed-loop control executes fixes
- System learns from outcomes
- Knowledge converts to code

---

## Proof Points

1. **Real work orders** from Stardust Racers roller coaster maintenance
2. **Working prototype** on Allen-Bradley Micro820 with Modbus TCP
3. **Father-Son Build** — live demo hardware in progress
4. **4-layer architecture** validated and documented

---

## Why Now (2026)

1. YC explicitly requesting agentic AI for vertical industries
2. 50%+ of YC batches are now agentic AI companies
3. $91B industrial automation market, 95% still reactive maintenance
4. Edge compute finally powerful enough for local LLMs
5. AlixPartners predicts $500B AI collapse in enterprise SaaS — per-device pricing wins

## The Mantra

> "The PLC is the brain. If you want AI to actually help, it needs to be IN the brain."

> "We don't sell software. We sell uptime."

> "We're not building tools for technicians. We're building the technician."
