## Differentiation Strategy

**Don't compete on their terms.** Instead:

1. **Go deeper on PLCs** — They treat PLCs as data sources. We understand them.
2. **Price transparently** — They hide pricing. We show it.
3. **Target the forgotten** — Small shops with 10-50 employees.
4. **Build in public** — They're corporate. We're human.
