## LinkedIn Algorithm 2026 (Key Changes)

Source: Forbes, Chris Donnelly (1.2M followers)

### Critical Updates

1. **Profile signals authority** (360 Brew update)
   - Algorithm reads headline, about, experience to verify expertise
   - Content must match stated expertise
   - Healthcare pro posting crypto = limited distribution
   - **Action:** Mike's profile should clearly state industrial AI/maintenance

2. **Saves are the #1 metric**
   - Bookmarks > likes > comments for algorithm weight
   - Saved posts resurface for weeks
   - **Action:** Create content worth bookmarking (frameworks, checklists, guides)

3. **Consistency beats timing**
   - "There has never been a golden hour"
   - Random posting is "tactically bad and damaging"
   - **Action:** Pick a schedule (e.g., Tuesday 10 AM) and stick to it

## Content Formats That Work

### High-Engagement Formats
1. **Frameworks & Checklists** - Saveable, referenceable
2. **Story-based posts** - Personal experience + lesson
3. **Contrarian takes** - Challenge conventional wisdom
4. **Data/stats** - "70% of CMMS implementations fail"
5. **Before/after** - Show transformation

### Format Structure (Hook → Story → Insight)
```
[Hook] - Stop the scroll (1-2 lines)
[Story] - Personal experience or example (3-5 lines)
[Insight] - The lesson or framework (3-5 lines)
[CTA] - Question or engagement prompt (1 line)
```

## Industrial/Maintenance Content Themes

### Themes That Resonate
1. **CMMS struggles** - Everyone's been burned
2. **Technician adoption** - Getting people to use the system
3. **AI hype vs reality** - Skepticism is high
4. **Downtime costs** - Universal pain point
5. **Knowledge transfer** - Retiring workforce
6. **Safety culture** - Always relevant
7. **ROI justification** - Speaking to leadership

### Unique Angles (Differentiation)
- PLC/equipment integration (no one talks about this)
- AI that explains faults in plain English
- Built by maintenance people, not just software people
- Small team focus (not enterprise bloat)
