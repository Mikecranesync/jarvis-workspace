## Executive Summary

Analyzed content patterns in the industrial AI/predictive maintenance space. Key finding: **Case studies with specific numbers drive engagement and trust.**

---

## Content Patterns That Work

### 1. Case Study Format
The GM/predictive maintenance case study exemplifies high-performing content:

**Structure:**
1. Problem statement with cost/pain metrics
2. Solution overview (what was implemented)
3. Implementation steps (how-to element)
4. Results with specific numbers
5. Applicability to reader's situation

**Key Numbers That Resonate:**
- "800 hours of downtime per year"
- "$260,000 per hour" cost
- "1,200 SUVs per day" production impact
- "70% of failures predicted 24 hours in advance"
- "12-18 months ROI"

### 2. Pain-Point Hooks
Headlines that perform well:
- "Cutting Machine Downtime" — Direct pain point
- "Transforming Manufacturing" — Aspirational
- Numbers in headlines: "50% reduction", "$40K savings"

### 3. Credibility Anchors
- Named companies (GM, Rockwell, Siemens)
- Specific facilities ("Arlington Assembly Plant")
- Named roles ("Shop Manager", "Reliability Manager")
- Third-party data (Deloitte, GE Digital reports)

## LinkedIn Content Patterns

### What Works in B2B Industrial
1. **Before/After Stories** — "We were doing X, now we do Y"
2. **Contrarian Takes** — "Predictive maintenance isn't about AI, it's about..."
3. **How-To Lists** — "5 steps to implement predictive maintenance"
4. **Industry Stats** — "89% of manufacturers are investing in..."
5. **Question Posts** — "What's your biggest maintenance challenge?"

### Engagement Triggers
- End posts with a question
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include specific numbers/stats
- Tag relevant companies or people
- Use 3-5 hashtags max

### Optimal Post Length
- LinkedIn: 1,200-1,500 characters (not too short, not too long)
- Hook in first 2 lines (before "see more" click)
