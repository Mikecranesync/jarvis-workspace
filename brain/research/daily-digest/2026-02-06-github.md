# GitHub Daily Digest - 2026-02-06

## 🔔 Clawdbot v2026.2.3 Released (Yesterday)

**Key Changes:**
- **Cron improvements**: Isolated jobs now use `announce` delivery by default, one-shot jobs auto-delete after success
- **Cloudflare AI Gateway** support added in onboarding
- **Moonshot (.cn)** auth choice added (China market expansion)
- **Per-channel responsePrefix** overrides now supported

**Security Fixes:**
- Untrusted channel metadata kept out of system prompts (Slack/Discord)
- Sandboxed media paths enforced for attachments
- `whatsapp_login` tool gated to owner senders only
- Credential leakage prevention for gateway URL overrides

**Should we update?** Consider it - cron improvements are relevant for our heartbeat/automation setup.
