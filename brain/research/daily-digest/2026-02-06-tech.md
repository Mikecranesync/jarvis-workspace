## Top Stories

### 1. MIT EnCompass: Better AI Agent Search (Feb 5)
MIT CSAIL and Asari AI released **EnCompass** - a system that helps AI agents search for optimal LLM outputs by backtracking and making multiple attempts. Lets programmers experiment with different search strategies for more efficient agent work.

### 2. VS Code Multi-Agent Development
Visual Studio Code announced major updates:
- **Agent Sessions view** - unified Claude, Codex, GitHub Copilot
- Task delegation between agents
- New open standards: MCP Apps, Agent Skills
- Local + cloud agent support

### 3. Physical AI Moving to Production (2026 Trend)
Multiple sources predict **physical AI** (robotic agents, autonomous machinery) moving from pilots to production this year. Directly relevant to FactoryLM's industrial focus.

### 4. Agentic AI Predictions
- Every knowledge worker gets a persistent agent
- Multi-agent orchestration replacing single agents
- Many pilots cancelled due to ROI issues
- Governance becoming critical challenge

### 5. Claude's C Compiler (from GitHub scan)
Anthropic published **claudes-c-compiler** - Claude Opus 4.6 wrote a dependency-free C compiler in Rust with x86, ARM, RISC-V backends. Can compile a booting Linux kernel.
- 917 stars in days
- Shows AI can now write systems-level software
