## Key Findings

### 1. Efficient AI Models & Edge Deployment
- **Shift from scaling compute → scaling efficiency** (driven by 2025 compute shortages)
- IBM researchers (Kaoutar El Maghraoui) leading with AMD & NVIDIA collaborations
- Enables: remote healthcare diagnostics, autonomous drones, IoT edge devices
- Key constraint: power + latency optimization

### 2. Agentic AI in Industrial Operations
- **Major inflection point for 2026**
- Moving beyond analysis → autonomous action
- Capabilities:
  - Diagnose equipment failures automatically
  - Initiate corrective actions
  - Generate work orders
  - Coordinate responses across facilities
- **This is exactly what ShopTalk is building** ✅

### 3. AI-Native Platform Architecture
- Legacy IoT platforms being displaced
- New unified platforms combine:
  - Data ingestion
  - Contextualization
  - Analytics
  - Action execution
- Built ground-up for agent-based systems

### 4. Market Size
- Industrial AI: $43.6B (2024) → projected $150B+ by 2030
