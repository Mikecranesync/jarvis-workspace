# Emerging Tech Scan - 2026-02-06 14:36 UTC

## Summary
No major breakthroughs in the last 24 hours. Notable recent developments:

## Industrial AI
- **Dassault Systèmes + NVIDIA Partnership** (Feb 3): Developing industrial AI platform for virtual twins integrating NVIDIA Omniverse and Nemotron models. Enables autonomous production systems.
- **Deutsche Telekom AI Factory** (Munich): Launched with NVIDIA and Brookfield. Supporting digital twins, GPU-accelerated engineering. Building 100B parameter open-source "SOOFI" model. Data center construction planned for 2026.

## Edge Computing
- 2026 trend: AWS and Microsoft pushing AI marketplace integration for factory edge operations. Faster deployment cycles.

## Predictive Maintenance
- AWS, IBM, Microsoft, Cognite, IFS all moving to persona-based AI agents for maintenance workflows. Automating triage and risk detection from sensor data.

## Industrial IoT
- Hanwha deploying AI-integrated cobots and digital twins for factory monitoring
- Rootstock survey: 48% adoption rate for predictive AI in manufacturing

## Relevance to FactoryLM
The Dassault/NVIDIA virtual twin partnership validates our direction - they're going enterprise/cloud-heavy while we're going edge-first. Our 4-layer architecture addresses the gap they're not filling: affordable, internal AI for small-medium factories without cloud dependencies.
