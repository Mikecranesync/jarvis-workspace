# HART Protocol Research

*Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol*
*Researched: 2026-02-05*

## Overview

HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) is a digital communication protocol that layers on top of traditional 4-20mA analog signals. It allows smart field instruments to communicate digital data while maintaining backward compatibility with legacy 4-20mA systems.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Bi-directional digital communication over 4-20mA wiring
- Uses Bell 202 FSK modulation (1200/2200 Hz)
- Compatible with existing 4-20mA infrastructure
- Industry standard for smart instrumentation

## Technical Details

### HART Communication Modes
1. **Point-to-Point:** Single device on loop, analog + digital
2. **Multi-drop:** Multiple devices, digital only (4mA fixed)

### Common HART Commands
- **Universal (0-19):** All devices support
  - Command 0: Read unique identifier
  - Command 1: Read primary variable
  - Command 2: Read current and percent of range
  - Command 3: Read all dynamic variables
- **Common Practice (40-99):** Widely implemented
- **Device Specific (128-253):** Manufacturer specific

### Physical Layer
- Bell 202 FSK: 1200 Hz = "1", 2200 Hz = "0"
- Baud rate: 1200 bps
- Superimposed on 4-20mA signal
- Requires 250Ω load resistor

## FactoryLM Integration Potential

### Tier 2 (Connect) - Software Only
- HART-IP support via Ethernet
- Use hart-protocol Python library
- No special hardware needed for HART-IP devices

### Tier 3 (Predict) - With Hardware
- SDAFE-HART module on Pi for traditional HART
- Read diagnostic data from smart transmitters
- Predictive maintenance from HART device health

## Partnership Opportunities

1. **FieldComm Group** - Industry standards body, developer kits
2. **Widgetlords** - Pi HART modules
3. **Emerson/Rosemount** - Largest HART device manufacturer

---

## Key Insight

HART provides access to rich diagnostic data from smart field instruments that's often ignored. Most plants have HART-capable devices but only use the 4-20mA signal. FactoryLM could unlock this "stranded" intelligence.
