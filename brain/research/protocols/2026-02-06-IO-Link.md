## 1. Overview

IO-Link is a standardized, point-to-point communication protocol for smart sensors and actuators (IEC 61131-9). It's the "USB of industrial sensors" - bidirectional, plug-and-play, with automatic device identification.

**Key Features:**
- Bidirectional communication (read parameters, diagnostics, not just process data)
- Device identification (automatic sensor recognition)
- Parameterization (configure sensors remotely)
- Diagnostic data (health, errors, warnings)
- Standardized by IO-Link Consortium

**Who Uses It:**
- Growing adoption across all industries
- Major sensor manufacturers (IFM, Balluff, Sick, Turck, Pepperl+Fuchs)
- Especially popular in automotive, packaging, food/beverage

## 2. Physical Layer

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Wiring | Standard 3-wire (24V, GND, Data) |
| Connector | M12 (typically A-coded) |
| Max Distance | 20 meters |
| Data Rates | COM1: 4.8 kbaud, COM2: 38.4 kbaud, COM3: 230.4 kbaud |
| Power | 24V DC via same cable |

**Key Advantage:** Uses existing 3-wire sensor cables - no special wiring needed.

---

## 3. Data Capabilities

- **Process Data:** Cyclic sensor readings (up to 32 bytes)
- **Service Data:** Acyclic parameter read/write
- **Events:** Alarms, warnings, notifications
- **IODD Files:** Device description files (like GSD for PROFINET)

## 4. Open Source Options

### 🏆 Best Option: Pinetek IOL HAT
- **Repo:** https://github.com/Pinetek-Networks/iol-hat
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi HAT with MAX14819 chip
- **Features:**
  - 2 IO-Link ports per HAT (up to 4 with 2 HATs)
  - TCP socket interface for any language
  - Python and C examples included
  - Based on RT-Labs i-link stack (GPLv3)
- **Price:** ~€150-200 (estimated)
- **FactoryLM Fit:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perfect for Pi-based gateways

### RT-Labs i-link Stack
- **Repo:** https://github.com/rtlabs-com/i-link
- **Type:** IO-Link master stack in C
- **License:** Dual (commercial + GPLv3)
- **Platforms:** Bare metal, RTOS, Linux
- **Note:** Evaluation version, production requires license

### OpenIOLink Project
- **Repo:** https://github.com/openiolink/io-link-master-shield-hat-sw
- **Hardware:** Shield for Arduino/Raspberry Pi
- **Status:** Under development, less mature than Pinetek
- **Library:** C++ driver for MAX14819A chip

## 5. Commercial Solutions

### IO-Link Masters (Gateways)
| Vendor | Product | Interface | Price Range |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| IFM | AL1340 | Ethernet/IP, Modbus TCP | $400-600 |
| Balluff | BNI EIP | Ethernet/IP | $500-800 |
| Turck | TBEN-L | Multiprotocol | $400-700 |
| Sick | SIG100/200 | Ethernet/IP, PROFINET | $300-500 |
| Banner | IO-Link Hub | Modbus TCP | $250-400 |

### USB IO-Link Masters (for development)
| Vendor | Product | Ports | Price |

## 6. FactoryLM Integration Path

### Recommended Approach

**Option A: Pinetek IOL HAT (Best)**
```
[IO-Link Sensors] → [IOL HAT on Pi] → [TCP Socket] → [FactoryLM]
```
- Fully open source
- Direct Pi integration
- ~$200 hardware cost
- Python examples ready to use

**Option B: Commercial Gateway + Modbus**
```
[IO-Link Sensors] → [IFM/Balluff Gateway] → [Modbus TCP] → [Pi] → [FactoryLM]
```
- More expensive ($400+)
- But leverages existing Modbus code
- Better for retrofitting existing installations

### Code Example (Pinetek TCP Interface)
```python
import socket

# Connect to IOL HAT master application
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect(('localhost', 12345))

# Read process data from port 1
sock.send(b'READ_PD 1\n')
response = sock.recv(1024)
print(f"Sensor data: {response}")
```

## 7. Market Prevalence

**Growing rapidly:**
- 35+ million IO-Link nodes installed (2024)
- 50%+ annual growth rate
- Dominant in new smart sensor deployments
- Retrofittable to existing 3-wire installations

**Industries:**
- Automotive: Very high adoption
- Packaging: High adoption
- Food/Beverage: Growing
- Process: Lower (HART still dominant)

## 8. Partnership Opportunities

| Company | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pinetek Networks** | Hardware partner for Pi integration |
| **IFM Electronic** | Sensor + gateway supplier |
| **Balluff** | Sensor + gateway supplier |
| **RT-Labs** | Stack licensing if needed |

**Recommendation:** Reach out to Pinetek Networks - they're a small company building exactly what FactoryLM needs (Pi-based IO-Link masters with open source software).

---

## 9. Key Takeaways

1. **IO-Link is the future** - growing faster than any other sensor protocol
2. **Perfect Pi solution exists** - Pinetek IOL HAT with open source stack
3. **Low barrier to entry** - ~$200 gets a working 2-port setup
4. **Python-friendly** - TCP socket interface works with any language
5. **Partnership potential** - Pinetek is a small startup, could be a good partner

## Next Steps for FactoryLM

1. Order Pinetek IOL HAT for testing (~$200)
2. Test with common sensors (IFM, Balluff proximity sensors)
3. Build Python wrapper around TCP interface
4. Create "IO-Link" capability for Jarvis Node registry
