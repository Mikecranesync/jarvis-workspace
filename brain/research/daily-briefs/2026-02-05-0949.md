## Progress Today

### Completed
- ✅ Telegram webhook for network alerts (working - detected lid close)
- ✅ Windows device config scripts (lid close, power, Tailscale)
- ✅ Pushed to main - `irm | iex` pattern ready
- ✅ YC deliverables: 9/9 drafts complete

### In Discussion
- **FactoryLM Device Agent** - Mike wants elegant solution, not scripts
  - Pattern: Device calls home → gets config → reports status
  - This IS the FactoryLM product for edge devices
  - Spec needed before building

### Blockers
- Travel-Laptop offline (lid closed at work - expected)
- Device agent needs spec/approval before development

### Next Steps
1. Mike reviews YC deliverables
2. Spec out FactoryLM device agent if approved
3. Friday: Demo video recording

## System Health
- Celery: 1 worker, 0 failures
- Network: Pi-Edge & PLC-Laptop offline, Travel-Laptop offline (expected)
