## Content Patterns That Work

### 1. Tutorial Format
**Example:** "How to program a PLC from scratch"

**Structure:**
- Problem statement
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Screen recording with voiceover
- Real hardware when possible

**Why it works:** Technicians need practical skills. Theory alone doesn't cut it.

### 2. Troubleshooting Guides
**Example:** "5 common VFD faults and how to fix them"

**Structure:**
- Show the error
- Explain what it means
- Walk through diagnosis
- Demonstrate the fix

**Why it works:** Solves immediate pain points. High search intent.

### 3. Equipment Comparisons
**Example:** "Allen-Bradley vs Siemens: Which PLC should you learn?"

**Structure:**
- Side-by-side comparison
- Pros and cons
- Career implications
- Recommendation

**Why it works:** Decision support. Gets engagement in comments.

### 4. "Day in the Life" Content
**Example:** "What does a maintenance technician actually do?"

**Structure:**
- Follow someone through their day
- Show real challenges
- Humanize the profession

**Why it works:** Aspirational for newcomers. Nostalgic for veterans.

## Content Gaps (Opportunities)

| Gap | Current State | FactoryLM Opportunity |
|-----|---------------|----------------------|
| **AI in maintenance** | Almost nothing | First mover advantage |
| **Predictive analytics** | Vendor marketing only | Practical tutorials |
| **Fault code databases** | Scattered PDFs | Searchable video series |
| **Knowledge transfer** | Nothing | "Capturing tribal knowledge" series |
| **Smart glasses/AR** | Very limited | Future content angle |
