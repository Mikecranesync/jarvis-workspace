# Workflow: Creating Brain Documents

## When to Create Documents

### Journals (daily)
- At end of each significant conversation
- Summarize key discussions, decisions, learnings
- File: `brain/journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Concepts (as needed)
- When we discuss an important idea worth preserving
- Deep dives on technical or business concepts
- File: `brain/concepts/[concept-name].md`

### Research (every 4 hours)
- Automated research reports
- Deep dives, competitive intel, workflow improvements
- File: `brain/research/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

### Workflows (as created)
- Document processes and procedures
- How-to guides for recurring tasks
- File: `brain/workflows/[workflow-name].md`

## Document Template

## Best Practices

1. **Be concise** — Capture essence, not transcript
2. **Use headers** — Make scannable
3. **Link related** — Build knowledge graph
4. **Include "why"** — Context for future reference
5. **Tag properly** — Use correct folder

## Automatic Creation

Jarvis creates documents automatically:
- Daily journals after significant conversations
- Research reports every 4 hours
- Concept docs when important ideas emerge
