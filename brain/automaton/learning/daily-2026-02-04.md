   - Action: Create skeleton scripts for these automation tools
   
2. **PLC-Copilot down** - Failed 2 days ago, not restarted
   - Action: Fix bot conflict issue when Mike available
   
3. **Redundant scans** - Code improver rescans unchanged files
   - Action: Add file modification check before rescanning

## Key Learnings
1. Perplexity API model name changed from `llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online` to `sonar`
2. Brave Search API has rate limits (1 req/sec on free tier)
3. Mike prefers silent operation during sleep - held all non-critical pings

## Metrics
- Observatory logs generated: 4
- Research files created: 3
- Alerts suppressed (Mike sleeping): ~10
