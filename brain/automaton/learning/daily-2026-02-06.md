| Agent | Task | Runtime | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| yc-reviewer | Application review | ~2.5m | Found 3 critical issues |
| video-improver | Script analysis | ~2.3m | Identified weak opening |
| traction-amplifier | Reframe traction | ~1m | 40x speed positioning |
| electrical-engineer | Wiring diagrams | ~2.3m | Full specs created |
| interview-prep | Q&A preparation | ~2.4m | 20 questions ready |

### Wave 2 (4 agents) - 100% Success
| Agent | Task | Runtime | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| stat-sourcer | Verify statistics | ~2.4m | Found $260K/hr (5x better!) |
| pricing-fixer | Standardize pricing | ~1.4m | 7 fixes across 6 files |
| script-rewriter | New video script | ~1.2m | 3AM hook + prediction |
| competitor-intel | Fresh 2026 data | ~2.8m | MaintainX $2.5B valuation |

## Key Learnings

### 1. Sub-Agent Swarm Effective for Document Work
- 9/9 agents completed successfully (100% success rate)
- Parallel execution saves significant time
- Clear, specific task prompts yield better results

### 2. Statistics Verification Critical
- Original claims were inaccurate (95% → 58%, $50K → $260K)
- Higher real numbers ($260K/hr) actually strengthen the pitch
- Always source claims before YC submission

### 3. Gist as Document Delivery Works
- Created gist-publisher library
- Mike approved pattern for future use
- Instant shareable URLs without deployment

### 4. Hardware + Software Parallel Tracks
- Mike building conveyor while agents polish application
- Mechanical diagrams (budget + premium versions)
- Electrical diagrams ready for build

## Improvement Areas

1. **Learning Logger Script Missing** - Should create automated tracking
2. **Memory Search Disabled** - Gemini API key flagged as leaked
3. **Self-Evolution Script Missing** - Need to build automation

## Metrics
- Messages processed: ~50
- Files created/modified: 20+
- Trello cards created: 6
- GitHub commits: 1 (gist-publisher)

## Tomorrow's Focus
1. Record demo video (conveyor + FactoryLM)
2. Apply statistic corrections to all docs
3. Final application review
4. Submit before Feb 9 deadline
