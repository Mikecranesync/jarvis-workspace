## Learnings

### What Worked
1. **Following Commandments** - Issue → Branch → PR → Approval flow worked smoothly
2. **Breaking into messages** - Multiple Telegram messages for complex topics
3. **Preview server** - Quick iteration with Tailscale-accessible preview
4. **Listening to Mike's vision** - He had this documented already, I needed to find it

### What Could Improve
1. **Memory recall** - Mike had to remind me his vision was already documented
2. **Repo awareness** - Should have searched repos more thoroughly upfront
3. **Brand colors** - Should have used actual logos/colors from the start

## Success Metrics
- PRs merged: 1 (drag-drop configurator)
- PRs closed: 1 (superseded orbit design)
- Repos updated: 7+ (vision/commandments)
- Documents created: 5+

## Top 3 Improvement Areas
1. Better memory search at session start
2. Check Mike's existing repos before proposing "new" ideas
3. Use brand assets correctly from the beginning

## Quote of the Day

Lesson: Search before building. The answer is usually already there.
