# Automaton Principles — Self-Improvement Knowledge Base

**Created:** 2026-01-31 10:00 UTC
**Purpose:** Meta-level knowledge for improving the autonomous system itself

---

## Core Principle

> When Mike asks questions, use them to improve the automaton — the knowledge base, background processes, cron jobs, and self-improvement capabilities.

**Industrial maintenance questions** → Feed ShopTalk knowledge base
**System/process questions** → Feed Automaton knowledge base (this)

---

## What Is The Automaton?

The automaton is the entire autonomous system:
- Background cron jobs (monitors, scanners, agents)
- Knowledge bases and templates
- Self-improvement loops
- Research and learning systems
- Task queue and prioritization
- Memory and context management

---

## Improvement Categories

### 1. Process Improvements
- Better heartbeat handling
- Smarter task prioritization
- Reduced redundancy in updates
- Constitutional amendments from Mike

### 2. Knowledge Improvements
- Template libraries (PLCs, VFDs, etc.)
- Research findings (competitive intel, emerging tech)
- Networking opportunities
- Best practices learned

### 3. Automation Improvements
- New cron jobs for recurring tasks
- Better scanning and monitoring
- Proactive alerts and notifications
- Self-healing capabilities

### 4. Communication Improvements
- Voice + text constitutional amendment
- Task queue for tracking requests
- Honest status reporting
- Appropriate update frequency

## Lessons Learned (from today)

### 2026-01-31

1. **Task Queue** — Created TASK_QUEUE.md to track all requests
2. **Voice + Text** — Constitutional amendment for all replies
3. **Update Frequency** — Don't spam with identical 15-min updates
4. **Honest Answers** — Say what's done vs what's TODO
5. **Perplexity Integration** — Use for deep research, set up cron jobs
6. **Networking Calendar** — Proactive opportunity scanning
7. **Competitive Intel** — Know what exists before building
8. **Heartbeat Tuning** — Extended to 2 hours (was 15-30 min) to reduce noise

## Active Cron Jobs (Automaton)

| Job | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Monitor Agent | 15 min | System health |
| Code Agent | 30 min | GitHub issues/PRs |
| Autonomous Progress | 15 min | Status updates |
| Emerging Tech Scan | 4 hours | Perplexity research |
| Networking Scanner | 4 hours | Trade shows/opportunities |
| Research Report | 4 hours | Personalized briefs |
| Daily Brief | Daily 2:30 PM CT | Morning news |
| Compliance Agent | 6 hours | Activity audit |

## Future Improvements (Backlog)

- [ ] Build complete PLC template library
- [ ] Auto-discovery for unknown devices
- [ ] Self-training from conversations
- [ ] Pattern recognition for repeated questions
- [ ] Proactive suggestions before Mike asks

---

*This knowledge base grows with every conversation.*
