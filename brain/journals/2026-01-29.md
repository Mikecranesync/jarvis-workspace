# Daily Journal — January 29, 2026

## Summary
Major infrastructure day. Established formal operating principles and deployed multi-agent architecture.

## Key Discussions

### 1. Engineering Commandments
Created the "Ten Commandments" for AI software engineering:
- Always create GitHub issues before coding
- Branch from main, never push directly
- Wait for Mike's verbal approval before merging
- Document everything

**Why it matters:** Prevents AI from breaking things. Creates audit trail.

### 2. The Constitution
Wrote a formal constitution defining:
- Mission: Ship products, generate revenue
- Competitive mandate: We're in a race
- Proactive agency: Don't wait to be asked
- Boundaries: What requires approval vs. autonomous action

**Why it matters:** Aligns all Jarvis instances to same principles.

### 3. Multi-Agent Architecture
Deployed two new "digital employees":
- **Monitor Agent** — Health checks every 15 min
- **Code Agent** — GitHub tasks every 30 min

**Why it matters:** Parallel work capacity. Specialization.

### 4. Bug Fix: Work Order Priority
Root cause: Gemini returned "CRITICAL" but CMMS only accepts NONE/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH.
Fix: Added `normalize_priority()` function.

**Lesson:** Always validate external inputs. AI can be confidently wrong.

### 5. Alignment with Alex Finn's Vision
Watched/analyzed Alex Finn's Clawdbot video. Key insight:
- Mike is *ahead* on engineering discipline
- Mike is *behind* on sensory interfaces (voice, browser)
- Discipline matters more for business

## Decisions Made
- Constitution ratified
- Engineering Commandments adopted
- Multi-agent architecture deployed
- Research reports every 4 hours (new)
- Second Brain app to be built (new)

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Complete Second Brain Next.js app
- First research report delivery
- Test mobile CMMS fix
- Review open PRs in Rivet-PRO
