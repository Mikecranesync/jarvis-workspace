# Daily Journal — January 29, 2026

## Summary
Major infrastructure day. Established formal operating principles and deployed multi-agent architecture.

## Key Discussions

### 1. Engineering Commandments
Created the "Ten Commandments" for AI software engineering:
- Always create GitHub issues before coding
- Branch from main, never push directly
- Wait for Mike's verbal approval before merging
- Document everything

**Why it matters:** Prevents AI from breaking things. Creates audit trail.

### 2. The Constitution
Wrote a formal constitution defining:
- Mission: Ship products, generate revenue
- Competitive mandate: We're in a race
- Proactive agency: Don't wait to be asked
- Boundaries: What requires approval vs. autonomous action

**Why it matters:** Aligns all Jarvis instances to same principles.

### 3. Multi-Agent Architecture
Deployed two new "digital employees":
- **Monitor Agent** — Health checks every 15 min
- **Code Agent** — GitHub tasks every 30 min

**Why it matters:** Parallel work capacity. Specialization.

### 4. Bug Fix: Work Order Priority
Root cause: Gemini returned "CRITICAL" but CMMS only accepts NONE/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH.
Fix: Added `normalize_priority()` function.

**Lesson:** Always validate external inputs. AI can be confidently wrong.

### 5. Alignment with Alex Finn's Vision
Watched/analyzed Alex Finn's Clawdbot video. Key insight:
- Mike is *ahead* on engineering discipline
- Mike is *behind* on sensory interfaces (voice, browser)
- Discipline matters more for business

## Decisions Made
- Constitution ratified
- Engineering Commandments adopted
- Multi-agent architecture deployed
- Research reports every 4 hours (new)
- Second Brain app to be built (new)

### 6. Jarvis Portal Launched
Built and deployed the Second Brain as "Jarvis Portal":
- Express-based document viewer (17MB RAM, lightweight)
- Full CRUD for brain documents
- System status dashboard
- Live at http://72.60.175.144:3001

**Next:** Add AI chat interface, nginx reverse proxy.

### 7. FactoryLM Rebrand Initiative 🚀
**MAJOR:** Mike decided to consolidate everything under FactoryLM brand.

Created:
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/Mikecranesync/factorylm
- 6 migration phase issues (#1-#6)
- Migration plan documentation

**Digital Twin Philosophy:**
> What we build internally = What customers get

This means our internal tools (Jarvis, CMMS, PLC Copilot, Second Brain) become the actual product. No separate "demo version."

**Migration Phases:**
1. Foundation setup (monorepo)
2. PLC Copilot migration
3. CMMS (Atlas) rebrand
4. AI Assistant framework
5. Knowledge Base
6. Integration & Launch

**Timeline:** ~8 weeks to full consolidation.

## Decisions Made
- Constitution ratified
- Engineering Commandments adopted
- Multi-agent architecture deployed
- Research reports every 4 hours
- Second Brain → Jarvis Portal ✅
- **FactoryLM rebrand approved** 🎯

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Start Phase 1: Monorepo structure
- Add AI chat to Jarvis Portal
- First research report delivery
- Test mobile CMMS fix
