### The Questions (Spanish)

    de servicios de petróleo en Maracaibo o el Lago?"

2. "¿Quiénes son ingenieros eléctricos, de instrumentación o 
    automatización que ahora estén en Houston, Colombia u otros países?"

3. "¿Conocen a alguien que haya trabajado con Chevron, Halliburton, 
    Schlumberger (SLB), o contratistas grandes en la zona occidental?"

4. "¿Qué empresas locales de electricidad/automatización todavía 
    están activas y haciendo trabajos para la industria petrolera?"

5. "Si mañana vinieran empresas estadounidenses de nuevo a Maracaibo, 
    ¿quiénes serían las primeras personas o empresas que llamarían 
    para poner a funcionar los pozos y plantas?"
```
