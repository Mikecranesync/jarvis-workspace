# YC Weekend Game Plan
**Take Friday Off. This is the play.**

## Timeline
- **Now (Wed night):** Robot army drafting application, video script, pitch deck
- **Thu:** Review drafts, refine at work breaks
- **Fri (OFF):** PLC laptop setup, demo recording, video editing
- **Sat:** Polish application, reshoot video if needed
- **Sun by 6 PM PT:** SUBMIT (2 hours buffer before 8 PM deadline)

## Mike's Real-World TODO (Friday)

### Morning: Setup (2-3 hours)
1. [ ] Go to bench with PLC laptop
2. [ ] Run ShowUI: `cd Desktop\computer_use_ootb && venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py`
3. [ ] Get Gradio URL, share with VPS
4. [ ] Connect Micro820 PLC (USB or Ethernet)
5. [ ] Open Factory I/O, load sorting station scene
6. [ ] Test: Can ShowUI control Factory I/O?

### Afternoon: Demo Recording (3-4 hours)
1. [ ] Set up camera/phone for founder video
2. [ ] Record 60-second founder intro (use video-script.md)
3. [ ] Screen record the demo flow:
   - ShowUI opens Factory I/O
   - Simulation starts
   - AI detects anomaly
   - Work order generated
   - Notification sent
4. [ ] Record B-roll: PLC hardware, wires, industrial vibes
5. [ ] Multiple takes - get good footage

### Evening: Editing (2-3 hours)
1. [ ] Combine founder video + demo footage
2. [ ] Add captions (YC watches on mute)
3. [ ] Keep under 60 seconds
4. [ ] Export and review

## Robot Army Handles (Autonomous)
- ✅ Application text drafts
- ✅ Market research (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- 🔄 Video script
- 🔄 Pitch deck outline
- [ ] Competitor analysis
- [ ] Technical architecture diagram
- [ ] Demo script/storyboard

## The Money Shot Demo
```
"Open Factory I/O" 
  → ShowUI clicks, Factory I/O opens
"Start the sorting simulation"
  → Conveyor belts move, parts sort
"Simulate a bearing failure"
  → AI detects anomaly in vibration data
"Generate work order"
  → CMMS creates ticket automatically
"Notify the technician"
  → Phone buzzes with work order
```

This is end-to-end industrial AI. No vaporware. Real PLC. Real software. Real results.

## Why Friday Off is Worth It

| Option | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Work Friday, half-ass YC | Probably rejected, back to day job |
| Take Friday, nail YC | $500K investment, quit day job, build FactoryLM full-time |

One day of PTO vs potential life change. Easy decision.

## Backup Plans
- If ShowUI doesn't work → Screen record manually
- If PLC won't connect → Use simulation mode
- If video sucks → Focus on written application (still strong)
- If deadline stress → I'm here 24/7, ping me anytime
