# The Two-Week Journey: Mike + Jarvis

**Period:** January 26 - February 9, 2026
**Total Duration:** 14 days
**Mission:** Build FactoryLM and apply to Y Combinator

---

## Executive Summary

In two weeks, a solo founder (Mike) and an AI assistant (Jarvis/Clawdbot) built an entire industrial AI company from scratch — including working products, infrastructure, and a YC application.

**Day 2 (Jan 28):** Architecture discussions. Defined 4-layer intelligence model.

**Day 3 (Jan 29):** Technical deep dives. PLC integration research.

**Day 4 (Jan 30):** Vision v0.25 formalized. FactoryLM architecture locked.

**Day 5 (Jan 31):** Competitive intelligence. Market research completed.

### Week 2: Execution (Feb 1-9)

**Day 6 (Feb 1):** Infrastructure expansion. Multi-VPS setup.

**Day 7 (Feb 2):** 🔥 **AUTONOMOUS OVERNIGHT SESSION**

## Key Innovations

1. **4-Layer Intelligence Architecture**
   - Layer 0: Code + KB (THE GOAL)
   - Layer 1: Edge LLM (Pi)
   - Layer 2: Local GPU (air-gapped)
   - Layer 3: Cloud (optional)

2. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - Mike's words = The Spec
   - AI converts speech to working code
   - Recursive learning from outcomes

3. **Universal Computer Program (RemoteMe)**
   - Control any computer from Telegram
   - Natural language → system commands
   - Claude-powered intent parsing

4. **Jesus H Christ (Repo Resurrector)**
   - Scans all repos for buried value
   - Commercial opportunity detection
   - Automated resurrection pipeline
